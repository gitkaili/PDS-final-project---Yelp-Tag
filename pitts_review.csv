The wait staff is also all super attentive. I wish I lived about 3 miles closer to them as I used to have them delivered all the time! 

My daughter decided she wanted to dress up and try Chinese food for the first time tonight. They don't have a kids menu but brought her the plain chicken and broccoli she wanted with the sauce on the side. She seemed to really like it although she decided the sauce wasn't for her (but it was very good!) My husband had their dragon roll and rainbow roll, which both were delicious. I went for shrimp and eggplant, and added on mixed veggies as I was feeling the need for some corn and broccoli. Highly recommend adding it onto this dish as it made it colorful and delicious! The dining room is also very pretty, and my daughter got home and said ""what a nice fancy dinner that was""  I have a feeling we will be back soon.",chinese

We almost didn't go in because my husband didn't like the way the outside looked, but we are glad we stayed. The service was good and the food was great. My husband loves sushi, but I'm not a fan and they idea menu items we both liked. We will be coming again if we are in the area again.",chinese

3,4.0,JJi7c7uiTzCqeWNTsldgXQ,"Oh, maybe I ordered wrong. Or this was the most boring Cantonese style food this close to the east coast. Nostalgic, like food my parents ate in the late '50s. I drowned it in mustard to eat it. 
Trying lunch one more time. Ordering special, and some sushi. Waitress was quick and helpful. Lunch was excellent. Sushi always great!",chinese

5,5.0,O5MzWfMWDeEwkzNVeKdCfg,This place is great! Appears to be family owned and operated. They work really hard making good Chinese food really fast. I've read a few negative reviews and having ordered it for a year now I can say it's always been good. I keep coming back.,chinese
6,1.0,O5MzWfMWDeEwkzNVeKdCfg,"This place is terrible. I ordered fried rice with chicken and sweet and sour shrimp. I received yellow rice, definitely not fried, and the only other ingredient in the rice was chunks of raw white onion. The sweet and sour shrimp came as overly battered and barely any shrimp compared to amount of breading. They served it with a side of duck sauce. It wasn't a composed dish and actually looked more like donuts when it arrived and I was super confused. Definitely will not make the mistake of ordering from here again.",chinese
7,3.0,O5MzWfMWDeEwkzNVeKdCfg,"The place is freezing cold, like the same temperature inside as outside.  People working there were wearing a coat inside because I guess they just don't turn the heat on to lower their gas bill.

The glass on the front door is cracked.  The floor is dirty.  The ""open"" sign is being held up by packing tape.  The chairs are ripped.  Lots of shady people in neighborhood.

The eggroll and the General Tsos were fine, just your typical Chinese place food.  But something was off about the fried rice, the taste and the color were both just off a little.  Prices are low, but you get what you pay for.",chinese

10,5.0,A5Xd85djipsW546Bq6qIYA,"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh. A little pricey, but the portions are huge. I always have leftovers. The entrees that I've tried have all been delicious, but the fried calamari appetizer is my favorite. I get it every time and often go there just because I'm craving it specifically. It has such a unique flavor and is fried perfectly. I also like how they give you free tea if you ask for it. This place seems to do a lot of takeout and delivery, so the restaurant itself is almost always empty, which I personally like. Every other place on Shiloh St. is loud and crowded, so this is a nice change of pace. Highly recommend!",chinese
11,3.0,A5Xd85djipsW546Bq6qIYA,"I just want to start by saying that I am used to Chinese food from San Francisco and this was my first introduction to Chinese food here. I found it interesting that they had Chinese and Thai options at the same place. 

The service was good, the restaurant itself needs updating (It wasn't necessarily dirty but it disrepair for sure. ie-water spots all over ceiling, dingy carpet etc..)

The Pork dumplings were really good. The sauce they give was delicious. The shredded pork dish was good but it doesn't mention in the menu which vegetables are cooked with it and I don't like some of the ones they included (celery, carrots). And I don't think it tasted very much like garlic. The lo mein was good too- but definitely not authentic. It tasted like buttered noodles and honestly had more garlic taste than my pork dish.",chinese
12,4.0,A5Xd85djipsW546Bq6qIYA,"Decor -dated and the carpet is dingy 
Service - friendly and quick 
Food- great, flavorful and big portion sizes (expect the rice you will prob have to ask for more) 

Apps - Crab Rangoon and veggie egg roll- everything was hot and fresh. 
Honestly might be the best veggie egg roll I have had. It wasn't greasy and the veggies inside were very fresh. 

Dinners- General Tso chicken and Orange chicken big portion sizes. I wish they gave you more broccoli with the chicken dishes. The orange chicken has a great flavor! 

Overall one of the best Chinese's restaurants in Pgh that I have come across so far",chinese
13,4.0,A5Xd85djipsW546Bq6qIYA,"I'm really glad they do delivery! They said about 45 minutes, and they came in that time frame.

Pretty good Chinese food for a very reasonable price. I got egg drop soup and chicken fried rice. I really liked the egg drop soup, it was different from any I've had before because it had a few vegetables added. The fried rice was pretty average, but good. The portions were huge.

I will definitely order delivery from here again.",chinese
14,3.0,A5Xd85djipsW546Bq6qIYA,"Definitely not worth the price. This place's prices are extremely inflated for flavorless basic Chinese food. The customer service was subpar. I ordered food to go and once I arrived home I ended up not being content with the meal once I dug in. I could've went to the super market to get my entree and be satisfied. 

For my entree, I ordered a light fare meal: broccoli with chicken. The meal was basic and simple. One good thing is that I enjoyed was the brown sauce on the side. 

I would order ahead of time if you want to pick your food up to go as you have to pay for parking Monday they Saturday (if you park in the parking lot).",chinese

18,2.0,odfX0wO7fOyqa8oobxh96w,Cheap food without a lot of love. Lunch general tso didn't contain anything but fried chicken and cheap sauce. Hot and sour soup was bland.

19,5.0,odfX0wO7fOyqa8oobxh96w,"Not sure about the bad reviews here!! I don't know enough to know for certain but I suspect that the food here is more authentic Chinese style instead of American Chinese style and thus people don't get what they are accustomed to and get upset.  But ANYWAY I think this place is amazing!  Just a little tucked away kind of hole in the wall place you might not notice, but they have the best sesame noodles and I also really like their egg rolls and my son got some soup the other day that looked amazing.  And the lunch prices are great.  I am a vegetarian so can't comment on any of the main meat dishes but the noodles and soups and veggie eggrolls are great!  I feel like this is a hidden gem!",chinese

They deliver with a minimum $10 order.   My orders have always been precise and timely.  It's a normal decent tasting Chinese restaurant.  The crab Rangoons are very tasty here though.  You really can't go wrong with the prices and they always honor the coupons on the front of the menu when you mention them.

30,4.0,5wr_UtUUdF8L2UlaD1DhNQ,"Let me start by saying that I am easily grossed out by gooey or soggy chinese food. I have had take out from here 10+ times over the past two years. It is ALWAYS cooked well and consistently flavored. The fried rice is better than most fancy chinese places that I have been. I always order the chicken and broccoli. My only complaint is that the meals come with steamed rice and instead of an upgrade to fried rice you have to buy a container of it. 

The broccoli is always very crunchy and fresh and the chicken is cut thin and flavorful. The brown sauce is not thick, which I like. The serving size is massive and I always get at least two meals out of my order. The price is pretty reasonable considering the portion sizes and quality. We ordered my meal, my bfs general tsos, fried rice, and 2 egg rolls for $25. If you can get past the hole in the wall appearance, this is the place to get takeout!",chinese
31,2.0,5wr_UtUUdF8L2UlaD1DhNQ,"I've eaten at this place numerous times. Don't get me wrong the food always tastes good but how it's prepared is just ridiculous! 
I got steamed dumplings and I swear it was like I ate a dough ball with little meat. I had to throw most of them away.
I got shrimp with snow peas and barely had any shrimp but a crap ton of chess nuts which I'm not a big fan of. 
Then every time I order a shrimp roll the proportion of the rooms are inconsistent. Last one I ordered was small other times they were big. 
Also I go an order of Crispy shrimp which the shrimp were coated with a ton a dough again.",chinese

Your chicken gave me PTSD.,chinese

The general tso's chicken was a little too hard but the flavor was good. The mixed vegetables with garlic sauce was SUPER DELICIOUS; they give you a lot of veggies too!

The prices here are pretty typical of Chinese-American restaurants. They've also got lunch specials and combination specials too. Definitely very affordable and the woman who was working was very nice and patient with us while we were deciding what we wanted to order. The food came out in less than 10 minutes and piping hot, so that was very nice.

I hate that they use the very cheapest plastic forks; you know the kind that can barley support the weight of the food.  A heavy duty fork costs an extra $0.001 per fork...

It's also kind of weird that there are like two Chinese restaurant right next to each other ""China Garden"" and ""China Buffet"".  I sort of assume they have the same owner and probably the same cooks.  But that's just an assumption.  Not that there is anything wrong with that, it's just a little weird.

And just to be clear, this review is about ""China Garden"".  I looked at some of the other reviews, and I think some people left reviews for ""China Buffet"" under ""China Garden"".  Hence showing the confusion.  I'll probably come back though.",chinese

54,2.0,fjE-jiwnTQysz-rLl6YMQg,"Yikes. Let's just say the Amazing Wok is NOT amazing. I should have known better because I read the reviews beforehand but I chose to listen to the wrong ones. Do not gamble on your dinner like I did - please go elsewhere.

I wanted some comfort food - you know, old school American Chinese food loaded with who knows what that just hits the spot. A simple mixed veggies with chicken in brown sauce, wonton soup and a shrimp egg roll. My fave place, My Thai, wasn't delivering, so I rolled the dice with this place. And simple is what I got...to the point of being bland and tasteless. My meal was impressively devoid of flavor.

The Good: The food was well-made. I saw actuality shrimp in the egg roll, the outside crust of the egg roll was made with real wonton wrappers, not that deep fried stuff, the veggies were fresh, the soup had actual shredded cabbage in it, and I think the meal was moderately healthy. So they get two stars for good quality and preparation.

The Bad: When I bit into my egg roll I thought ""uh oh."" It wasn't terrible, it was just flavorless. I tried adding duck sauce but that didn't really help, and the only flavor that I could taste was actually the slightly buttery taste of the wonton wrapper. This trend continued to the main dish, which had a brown sauce with barely any flavor either. The most I could taste was a slight sweet quality but it was so underwhelming I found myself wishing I'd ordered plain steamed veggies so I could have made my own sauce at home. Salting it would not have helped because the sauce had a flat quality about it and would have required a mix of ingredients to give it depth.

The Ugly: Weirdly, after all of this terribly bland food, the wonton soup was like drinking salty bathwater. It's like they held back on salting anything and then accidentally poured the whole shaker into the soup. I was starving and I ate that before my main meal or else I might have been unable to consume it. I was so disappointed too because it was texturally a perfect wonton soup - the wontons weren't too thick or chewy, the broth had thin slices of pork and shredded cabbage in it and it would have been the best part of the meal if it hadn't been oversalted.

Anyways, I was terribly disappointed and felt led astray by all of the great reviews. I should have listened better to the reviewers who called it bland. I took a chance and wasted $20. Don't make my mistake.",chinese

The black pepper chicken is excellent, and pretty much everything else is decent enough if a little on the boring side, given that it's pretty much the same standard Chinese recipies you expect in a typical Chinese restaurant.

Chicken was a mass of gristle attached to meat so dried out I threw it away. Even the hot & sour soup was full of tough stringy vegetables.

I ordered General Tso's chicken and I was surprised at the lack of quality. The general tso's sauce was  not flavorful and very runny. Also, usually General tsos chicken comes with broccoli. This dish came with carrots and peas that definitely came from a freezer bag because the carrots were chopped up into little squares. I hardly ate my dinner and our waiter didnt say anything about it. He asked if i wanted to take it home and I said no, he just took the plate and handed us our check. 

I may try Wai Wai again because of past visits, but I was just very surprised to see the quality of food deteriorate like it did.",chinese

73,4.0,i17-RGooGWIad0y5YtaBtQ,"I'm at the children's hospital with my son and was craving General Tso's so I decided to give this place a try.  I called and placed my order with a very nice lady.  My order arrived as requested (extra spicy, hold the broccoli) and it was nice and hot.  The fried rice and the egg roll were both great.  The General Tso's was good, but not really sweet like I've had pretty much everywhere else I've ever eaten it.  It had more of a tangy flavor with a faint sweetness in the background.  Perhaps that was because ordered it extra spicy?  I don't know, because when I order it that way at other places, I usually see more hot pepper flakes.  Anyhow, it wasn't bad and I'm not unhappy, but it was definitely not what I was expecting.

Secondly, to reach the minimum $12 purchase to qualify for delivery, I added chicken strips to my order.  I figured I'd just eat them tomorrow for dinner over my salad.  The ""chicken strips"" weren't strips at all.  They were exactly the same chicken they use for sweet and sour chicken.  See photo.  Again, it's not a big deal, I'll still carry on as planned with them.  Figured I'd mention it because if you try and pass those off as ""chicken fingers"" to your picky toddler, you may as well plan for the meltdown that will follow.  Haha! 

The delivery driver was very courteous and prompt.  If I have another craving for Chinese food, I'll probably try a different place (because I always order General Tso's), but I wouldn't be opposed to ordering from here again if I decided to venture from my usual dish.",chinese

The food was warm, and delicious. I got the sweet and sour chicken, and the sauce came on the side. I enjoy when they do this because I can use the leftover sauce to dip my egg roll in. 

A few negatives included: no fork or napkins in my delivery order, thankfully I was at home and had some on hand. They also didn't read my special request, in which I requested duck sauce on the side. Thankfully, I had the sweet and sour sauce to hold me over.

Overall, I will order from them again!",chinese

We ordered the Kung Pao Shrimp which is one of my favorite ""go-to"" dishes. The service was quick and efficient and the overall portion was enough to feed us both. In addition to the generous portion we both liked how they did not skimp on the peanuts or shrimp - the peanuts were not too salty and the shrimp was thick and tender. We both also really liked the sauce - it had the perfect amount of kick. The vegetables it came with - the celery, carrots, water chestnuts, mushroom and zucchini - were all cooked to the perfect amount of crispiness. The dish had everything you could want in Kung Pao Shrimp.

I also ordered shrimp in lobster sauce to go. Just sampled some of that and have to say it's the best I have had in years. The prices are insane too!

85,3.0,Lw2vlPixPe72lDp9Cx6GoA,"I must say I do appreciate the newer location closer to the borough building, and my house, rather than where Wangs used to be near Burger King in Brentwood. I have to say that there isn't much different here than any other Chinese restaurant. I wouldn't eat in here it's more of a take out or delivery style. Orders are always 10 minutes and due to the location it is great for me when wanting Chinese quickly. The prices are average, typical $7-15. 

My main reason for only 3 stars is the staff here isn't very personable. The service is sort of shove your plastic bag with your food in it in front of you, give your total and give money. The woman there almost everytime I've been there isn't very friendly and very expressionless. Just seems cold to me as if unappreciative of customers. I think it would make the customer's experience more pleasant with better, friendlier service as well as make you want to come back to the restaurant.

Most annoying was the very pliable plastic fork - it was impossible to pierce the veggies.

I took a menu home to try some more options but I definitely see it as the best Chinese takeouts in a 5 mile radius just based on 3 visits. Definitely better than Wangs.

Will definitely be back.",chinese

The food was all hot and the outside of the chicken was crispy but not over cooked or over sauced. The egg rolls are crispy on the outside and the filling is delicious. The rice was a little undercooked and the ham in it wasn't very good and tasted like it was from a can. Other than that the food was good. You also get a free two liter with a purchase is $25 or more. Definitely would recommend it and go there again.,chinese

The taste of my orders was always kind of ""meh"" - not terrible but not memorable either. I didn't even finish my last order of General Tso, since the lackluster flavoring hardly seemed worth the calories. And speaking of calories: the orders themselves always seemed extra greasy, to the point that I suspect that eating here after modifying my eating habits over the spring might overwhelm my poor stomach. 

My final star rating is based on the fact that I expect Chinese food to be an affordable and appetizing ""cheat meal"" when I do order it. Red Dragon unfortunately falls short, especially compared to the quality of other local eateries (Chinese and otherwise) - hence the 2 stars.",chinese
95,4.0,IcrFc5IwCcKyGbVmgWjVjg,"This place has a new owner and they have more Taiwanese cuisine options. I think the foods are overall pretty tasty with reasonable prices.

I can't speak to the former but the latter( Taiwanese food) is extremely good!  I really encourage everyone to try the Taiwanese food!  This place has the most authentic Taiwanese food in Pittsburgh... and I've tried quite a few!

Do yourselves a favor and try it out!",chinese
97,4.0,IcrFc5IwCcKyGbVmgWjVjg,"It's pretty typical Chinese food.  The taste, flavor, texture is all equivalent to other Chinese places in the area.  And by that i mean i enjoy it.

The tables and chairs are good quality.  A lot of Chinese places in Pittsburgh have cheap tables that are falling apart and not level.  But Red Dragon has good quality.  Red Dragon also uses real plates, silver-wear, and glasses; which again not all Chinese places in the area do.  So thumbs up for the tables and plates.

I was a little confused for a second though, because this place was called ""Tasty Chinese Restaurant"" in the past, and now they're called ""Red Dragon"".  It's the same address, phone number, it just has a new name now.  Other yelp reviewer Joel A, says in his review that the old lady who Ran Tasty is not at Red Dragon; that's unfortunate, she was really nice.

A small problem I have though, is that ""Sherry F"" on Yelp is clearly a fake review.  And on top of that Sherry F stole my picture.  I took this picture of their General Tso and put it on Google Maps https://tinyurl.com/yadtd6o4 over a year ago.  And now Sherry F stole my picture and uploaded it to Yelp https://tinyurl.com/y8pyffw3

My photo was for ""Tasty Chinese Restaurant"" not for ""Red Dragon"".  In Sherry F's review she mentions a new chef from Taiwan.  That's fine, but if it's a whole new restaurant now, why are you using photos from the old restaurant???  Not only are you stealing people's photos, but those photos don't even represent the food at Red Dragon, because they were taken at Tasty Chinese.

As I'm writing this Red Dragon's Yelp has two 1 star reviews, and one 5 star review.  The one 5 star is from Sherry F.  Sherry seems to be copying many photos from many other people online.  And the only review she ever wrote on Yelp is for Red Dragon.  Yelp's Content Guidelines have a general guideline that says not to review your own business, and doing so is a conflict of interest.  And Sherry F doesn't disclose her connection to Red Dragon in the review.

I came to Yelp planning on giving them a 5 star, but am lowering it to a 4 after seeing them try to deceive customers with a fake review.",chinese

99,3.0,N9JASBwB9kWtK0_EjTa1nw,"Yesterday we had a hankering for Chinese food.  Generally when we order Chinese we drive all the way down town to our favorite place but I just didn't feel like driving that far, or paying that price (I have a big family).  As a result I did what any intelligent person should do and I hit up Yelp for recommendations!

I scoured the local area for non-chain take-out joints and was suddenly reminded of my youth when I saw Chan An pop up with 4 stars!  Years ago, when I lived in the neighborhood, I frequented Chan An and it was always pretty good.  In fact, I remembered the food being good and fairly inexpensive!  I decided that it was time to return to yesteryear and did some searching on-line for a menu. I don't think that the menu has changed much in 15 years. Trust me, there are a TON of options here.  In spite of a million options we ordered the usual for our family which is: a couple orders of sweet and sour chicken, General Tso's Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice, and some egg rolls.  Like I said, i'm feeding a small army.  I was pleasantly reminded of how quickly they prepare food when I was told the order would be ready in 10 Minutes!

I immediately hopped in the car and ran over to pick the order up.  I live just over 10 minutes away and, believe it or not, everything was prepared and neatly packed right as I arrived.  Perhaps the best part, which almost made this 4 stars for me, was the PRICE!  When I go down town for Chinese we are easily close to $70.  I expected Chan An to be around $50 considering all that we ordered but I was completely wrong.  Our entire order was $35!!!  I was thrilled, and horrified because sometimes you get what you pay for.  However, it cost me $35 to feed my family at McDonald's!  With the 4 star yelp rating in mind, I focused on being thrilled!  

In the end, all of the food was great.  My wife even said that she though the chicken in the Sweet and Sour chicken was slightly better than ""Dahn Tahn"".  I disagree, the food is hands-down better at the other place but Chan An was a win with everyone.  The food was all hot and prepared properly.  The meat was tender, the sauces were tasty, and the rice was steamed properly.  What more could you ask for?  In the end, I'd expect to pay close to $50 for this meal.  At $35 it is a steal and we will be back.  I didn't go with a 4 star rating because price is just not enough for me to rate a place with 4 stars.  The food was good, but it just wasn't 4 star good.  I'd go 3.5 stars if I could... but I can't.... so 3 stars it is.  Don't be afraid of 3 stars... Give Chan An a try.",chinese

I always get the cheese wontons because they are super filling and very delicious. You have to ask for the sweet and sour sauce. I usually get the general tso chickens with rice and it's always filling and filled to the rim.

I arrived and without even asking if I was here for take out or dine in the only person I saw working l in the restaurant the entire hour I was there told me to sit down. She helped the couple before me with their take out which was fine with me. I would have preferred to be asked if I wanted a seat in the dining area prior however that I could overlook. I sat down after she led me to the table and I ordered my meal ( eventually ) she was the only employee outside the kitchen so she had to answer the phones and take orders and then when people came to collect their take out she had to go back and forth between the kitchen and the register to check people out. There should have been a person which would wait on customers and someone Else to run back and forth between the kitchen, the register and answering phone. When she finally got to me I told her when I placed the order I had a coupon. I then asked to have broccoli because I prefer broccoli vs baby corn.  She arrived with the food without the broccoli. I asked her to please bring out the broccoli separate. She brought the smallest amount of broccoli I've seen in my life. I've seen more broccoli in lean cuisine frozen dinners. Then she says it's extra $2 so okay I'm not happy but I'll survive. I figured I'm getting $2 off with my coupon so it's a wash.40 minutes later I ask for my check and mention again I have a coupon. I asked for a take home container. She brings the take home box and the check. I give her the phone with the coupon from the entertainment app and she makes a huge fuss I didn't tell her about the coupon first so she won't accept it. I flat out told her I advised you three times I had a coupon I was using. It is not my problem that you are so busy worrying about checking out others, running back and forth to the kitchen to get take out orders and answering calls that you didn't hear me.

We got two taro bubble teas and a vegetable lo mein. It took forever to get our food since they probably had to make the bubbles fresh as they were still warm in the drink. The bubble tea wasn't that bad and I like the fact that they made the bubbles fresh but it lacked ice. The thing that bothered me the most was that the cap of my drink had a hole that was already poked through when I didn't do it and the straw was still in the bag. I had the impression that they gave me a used cap. The vegetable lo mein wasn't bad but it was a bit sweet which I thought it was weird.

Now, I recently went back and was once again impressed. The food was delicious and vegan-friendly enough that I was just as satisfied as my grandma. While the lines get long, if you dine early, the service is better and you can get a close-up view of the dumpling making.

This place reminds me a lot of a smaller family-owned version of Din Tai Fung (high praise!)

Vegetable Dumplings - omg these are so good and filling
Pork Soup Dumplings - I've heard great things by my family who orders them
Baby Bok Choy - a staple, always good with the veggie sauce
Pan Fried Green Onion Pancake - an actual sin they're so good
Pickled Cucumber - yum
Sliced Seaweed w. Minced Garlic - fine
Wood Ears & Tofu Skins - the mushrooms were good
Five Spiced Egg-Plant - yum
Shiitake Mushroom & Bamboo Shoots - too raw

I'm sure I'll be back, and I can't wait!",chinese
114,2.0,hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q,"Quick and easy spot to get some noodles. Great location on Forbes Ave in Sq Hill. Lots of college students end up here with CMU and Pitt being close by. That can be a good or bad thing depending on your style. Definitely makes for a casual atmosphere. I went on a Friday around 7pm and had a 15 minute wait for a two-person table.

The food is about what you'd expect for a cheap place that caters to students. We got the Dan Dan noodle bowl which had some heat for sure but otherwise was a bit bland. It technically had minced pork but that was relatively sparse. The baby bok choi plate has a lot of green on it but again very bland. Supposedly it had oyster sauce but I couldn't taste it. We were also very excited to try the green onion pancake but it fell flat. It was small and although the dough was nicely fried and crispy the inside was more air than green onion. Plus it took 20+ minutes to come out, so we were done with our other dishes even though it was supposed to be our appetizer.

Not to be too hard on this place. At least it's cheap and conveniently located. But you can do better for food.",chinese
115,4.0,hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q,"I am overall a fan of Everyday noodles.  I think that their food is consistent.  There service is solid and I know exactly what I am getting. 

This time around we ordered delivery.  Other than it taking a bit long, it was just like the restaurant experience.  Delicious broth packaged separately from the noodles (to prevent them from getting soggy in the delivery process).  We also got soup dumpling.... yummmmmm (thought better in the restaurant) and the pork pot stickers.  If I was going to knock points off for anything it would be that the wonton dry noodles have shrimp in them, luckily I am particularly sensitive to Chinese items that I can't see what is inside (I have had a number of risky situation with dim sum) and made my partner taste test.  Definitely contained shrimp.  I wish the menu would have been a bit more explicit.  The noodles (without the wantons) were delicious.

Continue to be a fan.",chinese
116,4.0,hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q,"Cool vibe spot with really good food!  You can watch the noodles being made by hand while you wait for a seat.  

We went family style so we could try lots of dishes.  For starters we had the wood ears with fofu skins and the pork/veggie pot stickers.  Both were unique and tasty.  Pot stickers were a little different than anywhere else I'd ever had them, in a good way.  Would recommend both.  We also ordered the baby bok choy with oyster sauce that sort of blended appetizer and side dish.  Great texture but not anything exciting.  

For meals we had two soups, two dry noodles, and a pork belly bun.  Probably the best thing we ate was the bun.  Incredible taste and texture.  Soups and noodles were very good as well.  I'd recommend the beef soup.  Excellent taste, spice, and cooked slices of beef.  If you're adventurous, go beef and tendon soup.  

It's closer to 5 stars, but I can't put it in that gotta go back right away category, but recommend to anyone who enjoys this type place or wants to experience it for the first time.  Last thing, parking is tough in the area and will probably have a short wait.  But worth it!",chinese

I also got an egg roll and an order of fried dumplings. Both were full of flavor, and I'll definitely get them again. We even got a couple of free doughnuts. Everything was so good! The staff were so friendly too! Great place, and we can't wait to go back and try more!",chinese

Delivery was fast and they found my place with no issues. (Not easy to do!) 

I deducted one star due to price --$15 is a lot of money for dinner when you didn't even get a full sized meal.

You've had it before and you'll have it again, which isn't a criticism per se, but just set your expectations correctly. They have a nice picture menu along with a white person menu with standards (e.g., general tso's chicken).

Located on Forward Ave near h, a street block that has seen better days. We went on a Sunday evening at 7 and it was crowded but we had no wait and it emptied out by 8/8:30. Service is prompt and very no frills although the servers answered all of our questions despite the language barrier. Prices are solid ($5-6 for appies and $10-13 for most entrees).

The oil was everywhere! We got the steamed dumplings which came soaked in reddish oil that had a sweet hint. We got the mapo tofu which was spicy and generally tasty but also came doused in a broth of oily sauce. The green beans with garlic, ginger, and minced pork was my favorite dish, likely because it had some sauce but much less oil! The Dan-Dan noodle appetizer also had only a coating of oil rather than a bath; they were savory with some minced pork mixed in. Note that about 80% of the items on the menu have some kind of pork in them (just a guess but probably not far off) so if you don't love eating piglets I'd avoid this place.",chinese

First we checked in with Yelp, but when we mentioned it at the arrival, they didn't even check our names, and they mentioned something about they did not take reservations tonight. We waited around only 10-15 min, so no big deal but I wasn't so happy about how we were treated at the door.

We got Tofu Teppanyaki and Fish Fillet in Hot Spicy Broth. The foods were okay, but the portions were smaller compared to other similar Chinese restaurants and bit pricey.

It was all fine but when we got the bill, they actually charged us $1 more for each dish. When we confronted it, the server looked us like some morons and claimed that the menu prices are old prices and they have new prices in the computer. So are we the crazy ones, when no one told us anything about those prices being wrong before we ordered?

The server came back later with just one of the items adjusted and very annoyingly said to us ""Okay? Okay?"" We were just way too tired, so we just signed and left. It was only $2 (ended up paying $1 more), but I could not be more unhappy after the meal. I triple checked and they also agreed that the menu prices were wrong, so I know I'm not making this stuff up. It's not about the $2 difference, but their attitudes really pissed me off.

There are many other honest restaurants in the city, so I would not waste my time going back there. I like to dine where they charge me the same price as the menu price.",chinese

I ordered through grubhub, and usually the expected time is ~30min-1hr. Nope! Mine has consistently been ready in about 20minutes, so as soon as I place the order now, I'm on my way over!

Sadly it never looks super busy inside. I'm not sure if it's just because I tend to order an early dinner/ or lunch from here, or if it's more take out orders. It looks super cute on the inside, but it's just easier for me to do take out. 

They have all of the standard american-chinese restaurant items. Sweet and sour, crab rangoons, general tso, etc. I personally feel the recipes for these are a ~little~ bit different but not always a bad thing, just not what i was expecting. 

The staff are always very nice. I think you need to be a little diligent yourself and make sure you get the right food/ etc because they can tend to have a lot of take-out orders piled up. But not a problem because i usually check before i leave. Haven't had an issue yet though. Word of advice, if you want more than a couple packets of soy sauce/ duck sauce, make sure you ask!! 

Good easy find. Kind of in a sketchy row of buildings, but that's not their fault and their restaurant stands out from the others nearby in my opinion.",chinese
133,4.0,hwe7f0QthkND-H4Ekg37qw,"I always pass by this place and I finally got to try it.

* Food: From the title of the restaurant, of course we had to try their dumplings and sushi. We tried their steamed dumplings, Szechuan Dumpling in Hot Sesame Sauce, Scallion Pancake with Beef, and my boyfriend got a plate of sushi (I don't remember what he ordered). The steamed dumplings and scallion pancakes was definitely one of the best I've had in Pittsburgh. The dumplings had thick dough and a good portion of meat inside. The beef was cooked just right with the pancakes. The Szechuan dumplings were okay, I felt that the paste they put on it was too sweet for what I wanted. 

* Cost vs. Worth: The whole menu was pretty inexpensive. The steamed dumplings were $5.50 for 6 dumplings and they were a good size. The scallion pancakes were only $7.95. Both of us were full by the end!

Will I come here again? - If I'm craving dumplings I will definitely come back!",chinese
134,2.0,hwe7f0QthkND-H4Ekg37qw,"My experience at New Dumpling and Sushi House makes writing this review challenging. My party of two showed up around 9PM Friday night and we're told to choose a seat. Our server quickly took our drink orders and brought us sake and ice water. After scanning the menu, we decided to try the sushi sampler for two. 

When our miso soup was brought out, we immediately noticed that the broth was much darker than miso soup usually is. I tried a few spoonfuls but immediately regretted it because it turns out that we were being served the dregs of the day's miso soup which were essentially overcooked seaweed, mushy tofu and about 8000% of our daily sodium intake.

Our waiter brought out the salad next, which was also a complete miss. The carrot ginger dressing and iceberg lettuce salad is hard to mess up, but New Dumpling and Sushi House somehow made this inedible as well. After two bites, the puddle at the bottom of my bowl put me off. It seems as though the greens weren't drained after rinsing and the dressing wasn't mixed again before going over our salads. 

When our server returned, we explained the issues we were having with our soup and salad. The server was apologetic and thanked us for our feedback, but at this point, my dining partner was ready to leave and get other food. Morbid curiosity won out, however, and we stayed for our sushi entree. 

Somehow, after presenting the worst salad and miso soup we'd ever seen, New Dumpling and Sushi House presented is with a decent plate of sushi. The sashimi was quite delicious, and my dining partner contends that it may be some of the best tuna and surf clam he's experienced in Pittsburgh. The house special roll was okay but had a lot of mayo-based sauce. 

The bottom line: I can't recommend New Dumpling and Sushi House at this point because there is such inconsistency in quality between dishes. If servers get soup and salads for diners, they need to receive remedial training on the basics.",chinese

The showtime was shortly after 9, so we wanted to make sure we got to Squirrel Hill around 7. Service was quick and efficient, so we had no issues. We even had time to grab a drink at Independent Brewing Company after dinner and before the show.

It is a bit hidden and if we hadn't known to keep an eye out, we'd certainly walk by without notice. Keep an eye for a sign on the sidewalk and head downstairs of a building and you're there.

Heading in, I knew this place was legit. It has the feel and the vibe. I was delighted.

We were seated and given water. We looked over the menu. Hubs was hungry, so we started with the scallion pancake. I wanted traditional food, so choose napa cabbage with wood ear and chives with squid. 

The scallion pancake comes out not long after. It's good, but not as flavorful as I was hoping. Hubs thoroughly enjoyed it and added chilli and vinegar to help add taste. The veggies come out next. This dish is it! Great flavors and through and through. It's the dish of my childhood. Hubs wasn't sure of wood ear at first, but found it delicious. We are each given a bowl of rice to balance things. Then, the chive with squid comes out next. It's definitely more chives than squid, but nonetheless delicious. Good garlic profile and tenderly cooked squid. Highly recommend!

Downside is that it's a little expensive relative to other Chinese restaurants in the area, but the authenticity is certainly there and it does offer certain dishes unique to the NE region of China (hence the name)

Visit one:  

Scallion Package.  Now this is the scallion pancake I remember and love.  The combination of chewiness and crispy edges is what it is all about, baby!

Steamed Fish (it was okay, the type of fish was not the one I was looking for).  Note: the soy sauce and scallions they used to cook the fish was great.

Sauteed liver, kidneys and intestines.  This was really really good!  Full of flavor and delicious.  No gamey taste and quite soft. Recommend.

Chinese spinach with garlic.  The way they cook these are different from the way the Taiwanese places as they cook them down more and they tend to be more saucy and juicy.  Good.

Second visit:

Pan fried Croaker: hella yeaz.  I wish I had the Vietnamese ginger/garlic sauce for this one but just eating them without any sauce or dip tastes just as awesome.

Spicy Chicken Gizzards.  Damn dude, I am beyond impressed with the ideal amount of spice and thise gizzards aren't tough at all!  

Napa and Woodear mushroom dish.  Super unique and again did not disappoint.  In fact, it worked in harmony with the spicy chicken gizzards to balance the palate!

Feeling home/family-sick (if that's a thing?) during the Lunar New Year, I made the trek to Squirrel Hill with some friends to finally try this place out! We went family style, getting an assortment of dishes to share. Fortunately, we also had a large enough group to warrant being seating at a large round table with a lazy Susan! 

We got a bunch of stuff: corn buns, a very classic 水饺, pan fried beef dumplings, liang pi (mung bean noodles w/ veg), cumin lamb, chicken & chili peppers, and garlic eggplant. Everything was prepared rather quickly for how busy it was (Saturday dinner), with the dumplings coming out within a few minutes and everything else following soon after. 

Dumplings are a comfort food for me and these did the job! They're served with a garlic soy sauce as well.  The mung bean noodles were also great. The perfect texture and tasty. For those who have not tried it, it may be on the slippery side and hard to maneuver, but totally worth the effort! The meat and vegetable dishes were great also! A bit spicy with the chili peppers but not unbearable depending on one's tolerance. Good portions for sharing and a good meat to veg ratio. One of my friends commented that the cumin lamb would make great tacos :) The buns were tasty, although oilier than I expected (I'm used to the steamed buns, whereas these appeared to be pan fried after the fact), but still tasted great and I was excited to find them on the menu!

I want to point out that this is the SECOND TIME I've had this happen. The first time it was in my very last dumpling and I thought it was a one time thing. 

Overall the food tastes average with an above average amount of grease. I've had a few different things and saucy dishes like sesame chicken are sticky, and their beef has a very soft chewy texture.

I took a star off because of the pricing. $0.9 per ounce doesn't sound like a lot but wait until you see your final price. Mine costs $18 and it didn't feel like a lot. Oops.

The decor has not changed much since I use to go here as a kid so it kinda has dingy/old vibe to it. However, I still love the noodle pictures that line the walls.

I ordered the pork lo mein and it was pretty good and priced about what is average for an inexpensive Asian restaurant. I remember that several years ago they had lunch specials that were a great deal. However, it seems like they do not have lunch specials anymore which was disappointing.

My fiancé also ordered the wonton soup. All 3 came out very fast! The crab Rangoon was so good! One of the best I've eaten ever. The sauce they give you is duck sauce with some hot mustard in it.. and it just works! My bubble tea was so good too! For my entree, I ordered a dish that is basically chicken and green beans in a brown sauce. That was so good too!

When the server asked us what we want to drink and said they had no warm water, we went for the natural option of regular hot tea. Usually in an asian restaurant hot tea is served free and they will at least let you know if it's not. However, it turned out the regular tea he served us was listed as 'bubble tea' in the menu and costs the same as the bubble tea with milk and bubble, without us even realizing it when ordering(if you order a bubble tea, they will ask you what flavor/toppings you like).  We suggested him to be more clear next time when people order 'tea'.  But he insisted 'just pay your bill, ok?' in an extremely rude and condescending manner. To be fair, we didn't refuse to pay for the bill. What annoyed us is his attitude. If he had just said sth like ' sorry for the confusion, I'll be more clear next time', we wouldn't be spending time on writing this 1-star review here.",chinese

I ordered an eggplant dish, but they were running short of eggplants. Instead of just giving me smaller portion of food, like what many other super cheap places do, she brought what she had left and asked if I would take it mixed with other additional ingredients for free or order something else.

The fried rice that came with both the sesame chicken and the lomein might as well have been steamed rice with soy sauce dumped on it as there was nothing about it that made it fried....

* Food: As good as Chinese-American food can get. I usually get the classic Chicken and Broccoli and I am always satisfied. Their General Tso's tofu and Orange Chicken is pretty good as well.    

* Price vs Worth: I like how they have an option of Small ($6-$7) or Large ($9-$10) because I personally don't like to have leftovers so a small portion is perfect for one meal. You also have the option to pick white or brown rice as well! It is definitely worth the price.

I ordered delivery and it came within half an hour and the delivery man was very nice and polite, but the food was not that great.

I love American-Chinese food; but if there's one thing worse than the food coma afterwards, it's when the food itself wasn't even really good to begin with.

General tso's chicken combination platter: this comes with a side of either white or fried rice and a soup or egg roll. The general tso's chicken tasted fine, outside wasn't as fried as I would've liked but it also wasn't overfried (which is usually the issue with most American-Chinese food places). The pieces of chicken are big, a lot of broccoli, and the white rice was good.

Hot and sour soup: I would not order this again. Waaaaaaaay too much oil, so much that it separated on top and also my spoon changed colors because of the oil. I've never had so much oil in hot and sour soup before. It's also way too watery/thin for my personal taste, usually I feel like hot and sour soups are thicker. 

Egg roll: outside was still wet with oil and the inside was wet for some reason. I don't know why. It tasted really good and the outside was crispy but the inside was just wet and it was not fun to eat.

I don't have high standards for American-Chinese food restaurants, but this was actually kind of disappointing, which is a shame because their service was super great and friendly.",chinese

The good: fried chicken, taro cake, tea (kind of. I think the branch in squirrel hill is maybe better in terms of tea quality), close to CMU campus 

The bad: a bit watery tea, marinated meat rice can be too salty, waiting area can be a bit congested, all the vegetables are just frozen mixed veggies, and things here are cash only for things less than $5. Plus, now that Night Market Gourmet is open, you can get much of the same dishes for much higher quality and the same price (including said fried chicken over rice. The Night Market Gourmet version even comes with actual vegetable sides!!)

Bubble tea sounded really good so we decided to stop in.  We didn't really look at reviews pior but now that I see it, I understand why the ratings were so low.  The lady behind the counter was impatient for us to order and wasn't very friendly while we tried to decide what we wanted.  She was quick making our order after it was placed though.  The bubble tea came out pretty diluted and a bit on the bland side - I wish they used a stronger tea and maybe less milk?! The boba was good, though not the best I've ever had.  They were maybe slightly overcooked.  The only thing I liked was that the bubble tea wasn't overly sweet - but this is probably more due to the fact that it was diluted and not because they deliberately made it less sweet.  They do not have an option to adjust/choose your sweetness level.  Maybe they are better in their slushy/food options, because there is a dine-in area in the small cafe.

It's a walk up counter with outdoor seating available. A friendly girl opened the sliding door for me to order. They had a decent selection of dishes. I ended up opting for a tea drink which they had about six or seven options. I chose their strawberry bubble drink.

Within a few minutes it was ready and I pretty much devoured it. Tons of bubbles inside to chew on and the strawberry drink was not really what I was expecting but I ended up really liking it. It wasn't tea and milky and it wasn't necessary a smoothie it was some sort of hybrid which I really liked overall. And it was only $4 or so for a large which I enjoyed even more.

It had a nice honey dew flavor (which is my go to flavor for boba teas), the perfect amount of coldness to make it extra refreshing on a hot summers day and a good amount of chewy boba pearls. It seemed a tad bit sweet but I felt that was more of a reflection of the fact that the flavor itself was more concentrated than other bubble teas which for all intensive purposes attested to the fact that it was good quality. The slushy/foamy texture at the end made it a bit hard to drink the remainder of the boba so I would suggest adding a little milk at the end to savor the rest of the flavor.",chinese

I ordered a sweet and sour chicken combination plate, my husband ordered a chicken chow mein combination plate, and we got our son a small bowl of chicken and broccoli. We also ordered fried cheese wontons and egg rolls. To their credit, the sweet and sour chicken was actually pretty good. When I go to a Chinese place I've never been before I usually go for something that's pretty fool-proof and my method paid off this time. The fried rice was terrible; it contained no egg and not ONE piece of pork, which the menu claimed it would. Pork fried rice should include pork. 

We're new Pittsburghers from California and back home, chow mein means a plate of noodles. My husband got an extremely pale plate of... onions and zucchini, I think? The chicken looked cooked but the whole meal, overall, looked fairly pale and unappetizing. It came with ""crispy fried"" noodles to mix into it but they tasted stale and didn't do much for it. We threw that entire meal away. 

Pros:
-sweet and sour chicken was good
-fried cheese wontons were good

Cons:
-food didn't seem entirely fresh, even though it's supposed to be made-to-order
-menu confusion resulted in a kind of ""too bad"" shrug from the staff

I started with the wonton soup, which is probably my favorite over any other.  I used to always get chicken chow mein, so opted for that again.   It wasn't as good as I remembered it.   Partly because it wasn't hot enough, and partly because it wasn't as flavorful.    Nevertheless, I ate about half and took some home.

Situated right off Grant and 3rd, it nicely tucked away and has a parking lot to the side for those driving. Once inside the lights are low and it felt peaceful and inviting. Definitely not the hole-in-the-wall I was expecting to find. 

We were promptly seated in a booth in the adjacent room and provided water (we didn't want tea). The menu is both extensive and interesting. My wife opted for Honey Sesame Chicken with fried rice and I got the Ma Po Tofu with steamed rice. 

While we waited for our entrees we were given fried wonton wrappers and a sweet (maybe chutney?) and horseradish sauce. These weren't the highlight of the meal, but were nice to munch on. 

The meals came out piping hot and with more than enough for 4 people to share. The portions are very large but everything was fresh and flavorful. 

The Ma Po Tofu wasn't what I expected given I've had this in Hong Kong a number of times, but I liked the soupiness and it had some pickled vegetables much like a hot and sour soup does. 

My wife's meal was very tasty as well--I liked it better than my own and the fried rice was just like I remembered it from my time in HK. Way more authentic than fried rices you will get at other Chinese places.

The menu has all of the favorites you expect from a Chinese takeout place, but the cooking doesn't do justice to what the dishes should be.

The restaurant often puts too many vegetables, is conservative on flavor and tapioca powder, and overall really misses the average flare of American Chinese food that you'd expect---it's more like a home style taste than anything.

For example, the general tsos chicken is not fried enough, the sauce is not pungent, and the chicken is dry. The Mongolian beef is just a search for a piece of meat along the onion forest, and the Hunan Beef is a jumbalaya of veggies you don't want to eat.

Pork Fried Rice (very oily with no vegetables, just a greasy mess only ate two bites before we threw it out)
Singapore Mei Fun (one of the best take out versions we ever had)
Crab Rangoon (decent, but not crispy)
Egg Rolls (decent)
Steamed Dumplings (gross)
Spare Ribs (another great version)

Overall if we needed another late night meal we might order from here again, but probably not.",chinese
204,1.0,izOvku5li7kyzY76UzLP2g,"1.5, but I'm rounding down.

I ordered some crab rangoons and steamed beef and brocolli from Yen's. I am almost certain that one of the vegetables they steamed was rotten, because I had to spit it back out (it had a horrid sour taste to it). Also, the beef looked and tasted like rubber.... Overall, I was just very dissatisfied with the whole meal. I basically threw it out and for sure will not be ordering from this place again.

Some other negatives:
- The entire restaurant was empty. Because the restaurant is spacious, it made the emptiness seem that much worse.
- There is a sign outside the restaurant that states ""$5 for walk-ins""... Ok, what the hell does that even mean? So, if I placed my order on the spot instead of calling in ahead, then does that mean that I would have gotten my meal for only $5? There needs to be some clarification on that! Plus, it made me feel pretty crappy as I paid more than double that for my shoddy (aka. sh*tty meal).",chinese
205,3.0,izOvku5li7kyzY76UzLP2g,"I think I found my friendly neighborhood cheap Chinese restaurant!  (FYI: The sign on the awning says China Star, but the menu says Yen's and they say Yen's when they pick up the phone.  Not sure of the reason for the discrepancy.)

The previous tenant of my apartment left the menu lying around, and last night we were desperate for dinner so we decided to check them out.  Two vegetable spring rolls and two entrees cost less than $20 and were ready to pick up in 10 minutes.  (Delivery would have taken 40 minutes even though we live half a mile away.)  My boyfriend picked up the food and said the place seemed very clean.

The spring rolls were good and crispy.  The vegetable fried rice had more than the requisite peas and carrots - there were mushrooms, corn, and even zucchini, which I don't think I've ever had in Chinese food but it was pretty good.  The Mongolian beef was not just a pile of beef - there were plenty of onions and green onions to add color and texture.  Portion sizes were more than adequate and we both had leftovers.

The best part is the price.  The only entrees over $10 are the ones with seafood.  All of the lunches (with rice and soup) are under $5!  (Except for the ones with shrimp, which are $5.25 - still a good deal if you ask me.)

I would definitely recommend Yen's if you live in the neighborhood - it looks shady from the outside but I thought the food was better than Silk Pagoda's.",chinese

Largely the problem here was service in the restaurant.  Our drinks at the bar were perfect and the bartender was efficient and made good drinks.  The dining room was another story.  We sat for 12 minutes before our server even approached the table.   He very quickly took our drink order and brought the bottles of wine.   We ordered appetizers and entrees.   

One appetizer came out after a short while, and he explained that they burned the other one and were making a new one.   So now one couple is eating and the other is waiting.  They asked for a sauce for their appetizer and it never came.    Finally when he brought the other appetizer they reminded him and it came after they were done eating. 

We ordered 2 items to share and asked for plates.  We sat and sat waiting for him to bring plates.   The food was scant.  We had Kung Pao chicken and chicken lo mein.  No leftovers because there wasn't much food to begin with.   Our friends were underwhelmed with their meals as well.

211,5.0,7LlND5b0bjWylNBNQ-oZMA,"Green Garden is my go-to for cheaper Chinese food in the South Hills. Sure, there's more authentic and potentially tastier fare in the area, but ordering from Green Garden is the most wallet-friendly option. And their food is not bad by any means, either.

It helps (me at least) that they offer a lighter-fare menu. A super small lighter-fare menu, sure, but it exists! And honestly, being able to just get steamed chicken and broccoli with rice and brown sauce is a good way for me to satisfy my Chinese food craving without binging to the point of feeling guilty. Their beef on a stick appetizer is another favorite of mine, as it's usually quite tender and delicious! Since I rock climb for my workouts, these skewers are often all I want in life after a good day at the gym. Tasty protein for the win!

Delivery service is always timely and fast, and picking up food is easy as well. Delivery or pick-up will be the way to go, however, as their storefront is quite small.

Wonton soup- Disgusting. The broth was actually just greasy water, and the wontons were mushy and tasteless. 
Steamed dumplings- They were ok. Very thick & doughy, not great but not horrible.
Sesame chicken-  Pretty bad. Chicken was over cooked, and the dish was mainly tiny, hard pieces swimming in sauce. There was a strange flavor too, which I couldn't place.

219,4.0,a5xUI7TvsNhM5gZr6KowDg,"We were on McKnight Road running a few errands Friday night and were eager to try somewhere new. With a Chinese craving, we found Sesame Inn on yelp and were on our way! And I am so glad we found it!

In full transparency - the only reason I am docking a star is because there is a lingering scent of gasoline throughout the entire restaurant that obviously comes from its word location - attached to a car dealership. However, just get inside and the ambiance makes you forget all that! (Except the smell, which was something my dining partner didn't notice but I certainly did.)

What I loved about Sesame Inn is that there are few Asian cuisine restaurants that offer a nicer dining experience with a full bar, great ambiance, and attentive service. Though we did not drink, it was nice to have that option. 

I started with an order of the shrimp tempura roll as I wanted to try sushi from their open sushi bar. This was an excellent way to kick off the meal. So tasty! 

We each then ordered their sesame chicken, which I've had at almost every Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. This was some of the best! However, it definitely had a sweeter base than some others. If this is your thing, though, you would love it. The chicken came on a massive platter and I ate less than half my serving! 

We both agreed we would love to go back and appreciated the small details that made this a lovely dinner experience.",chinese

I've been to this restaurant several times.  Each time a pleasant experience!  Plenty of seating, great service, great food!   

I do find the location a bit odd but the dining experience makes you forget that it's attached to a Toyota dealership. 

We had Mai Tai's from the bar - also crazy good!  Very fair in price as far as I was concerned!

We will definitely re- visit this yummy little location!",chinese
221,5.0,EhlOUjd2dh52SV_XfoORSA,"I've been to this location dozens of times before using yelp. I must say their service is flawless and I've never had a bad dish here. My family friend and I almost always come here when she is in town. Best parking is in an open lot across the street which takes quarters but is free after 6pm, street parking is mostly difficult.

We are always greeted with smiles here and seated right away. I've never been here where there has been a long wait. I've also visited the north hills location which is probably the only establishment that I can say has equal good service and food at both locations. 

Our visit last week my family friend had the walnut chicken and my son had the chicken fingers and rice. The chicken fingers under the kids menu are actually sweet and sour chicken - this is one of my only two gripes as when you have picky children they don't associate these as being chicken fingers so if that could be clarified on the menu that could be good. It is nice to have a kids American option as a lot of parents want to get Chinese food but the kids don't yet have a taste for it. My second gripe is while I understand trying to have really good service, our waitress kept filling up our water glasses when they were basically almost full. She probably came over 5-6 times just filling a tiny bit of water which we thought was excessive. 

I had the walnut shrimp (first time trying) which is accompanied by vegetables - the walnuts are pretty large in size and so tasty. The tangy sauce is mouth watering and the meal is delicious. 

Our meal came out in about 10 minutes. However we didn't feel rushed other than the excessive water fills. We also had hot tea which is always a must here - their tea is just pleasant. Sesame Inn is and has always been one of my top go tos for Chinese food in the area.",chinese

The crazy tuna roll was lacking flavor, and the soy sauce tasted like there was ten lbs of salt in it. 

The shrimp with ""lobster sauce"" and brown rice was disappointing to say the least. It was $18 and had no flavor what so ever, I asked hot sauce to it just so I could eat it and feel somewhat fulfilled. 

Would not recommend this restaurant, mainly because there are other comparable restaurants that are much better within walking distance. This is sad because I believe the sesame in a little further down Rt. 19 is much, much better.",chinese

For our main course, our party of 3 split: eggplant chicken, orange beef, and chicken pad Thai. All of the portion sizes were large and even after stuffing ourselves we had leftovers. The orange beef was my favorite of the three - very flavorful though a little sweet. The eggplant in the chicken dish was cooked perfectly. I do, however, wish there had been more tofu dishes.

When the food arrived it was piping hot and smelled very good.  I had my old reliable, General Tso's, which was leaning more onto the spicy side, which I like.  Also had an order of the fried wontons.  Both were cooked amazingly and made my belly happy.  The helpings seem bigger than other places, so much so that I had enough left over for another meal.

Their food is top notch. There are 5 dishes by which I judge a Chinese restaurant: Wonton-Eggdrop soup, Moo Goo Gai Pan, Curry Chicken, Pepper Steak, and Lo Mein. I have so far eaten 3 of these dishes (The soup, the lo-main, and the curry chicken) and each dish gets 5 stars. First, most chinese restaurants in the area don't even have Wonton-Eggdrop soup (they have one of the other). Not only do they have it, but they have the big wontons like I am used to (and they're very yummy). The lo mein (I had chicken lo mein) was perfect - very flavorful and not too greasy as can be typical of some lo meins (theirs was more ""saucy"" as opposed to greasy. Finally, what I liked best was the curry chicken. I won't name names of other restaurants in the area, but let's just say I don't like watery sauces. Their curry sauce was very NOT watery, it was thick and delicious and they made it the way I like it, not too hot. In my dotage, my stomach has come to get very angry with me when I order food too spicy, although my mouth totally is on board (Sorry if that makes me a huge p@@@y, I am what I eat, get over it.) Anyway, I highly recommend this restaurant. Just a couple of minor things - I didn't get any fortune cookies with my lunch (not sure if this is standard or they just plain forgot) and I'm used to 8 wontons in a quart of Wonton-Eggdrop soup but they give only 4 (however, the wontons ARE big and the quart of this soup is fairly inexpensive, I am sure they'd give 8 if you pay a little more.)

Sometimes you get a sauce that can be way too spicy or way too sweet, but this one hit right in the middle and was satisfying.  I had also ordered a vegetable egg roll.  Amazing.

254,2.0,vGCAzbPIcZNkqNkKBbh4Ow,"This was my first time ordering from Dragon Town. I picked it because it was close and had decent ratings on GrubHub. However, the food was sub-par at best. The wonton soup had greasy broth and fatty pork in the wontons. The cashew chicken came breaded, which I didn't expect, and barely contained any meat; the dish was all vegetables and breading with very little chicken. Will probably not order again.",chinese

My fiance loves the beef and broccoli and I usually go for shrimp fried rice or lo mein (+ egg drop soup is awesome - it's the kind that has corn in it!).  Sushi is also very good.  

You know the food is good because every dish tastes different - unlike some Chinese restaurants where almost every dish just tastes like a variation of the same thing.  It's definitely a family favorite!",chinese

They accept reservations but you can generally walk in and be seated without having to wait too long. I do not eat sushi, but my husband and friends do and they almost always order a sushi boat. They make the sushi right in front of you at the bar and the boat is very impressive. We always get an order of lo mein as well as the general tso chicken and some soup. Everything is very fresh tasty, and the service is excellent. 

We will continue to visit Tai Pei regularly.",chinese

Our approximately 5 oz bowls of Wonton soups costed $2.00 each. They were merely ok. We would probably order the soup again.

My Vegetable and Shrimp with brown sauce dinner costed $11.50 and it was good. My wife's Sweet-and-Sour Shrimp dinner costed $11.50, also, but there was so much fried batter on the shrimp she had to cut some of it off to enjoy the ""hidden"" shrimp. She will not order that again.

Caution: If you want an extra serving of white rice be sure to ask what it costs before you order it. For a regular, about 8 oz, serving it costed $1.75. It was good but it was a surprise to learn it was not included in the price. 

There is no extra charge for water and we were glad they use paper sleeves on the plastic straws.

Their delivery is fast, and the food always arrives hot and served in a generous portion. Their menu is also very extensive and offers more healthy options than many other Chinese restaurants.",chinese
267,2.0,qAzOcHnWerREl678su-p0A,I was never a big fan of the food here. It's just like any other take out cheap Chinese food. The only reason I went here was because they had popping boba tea. They down graded to tapioca balls instead of the fruity balls that pop.,chinese
268,1.0,qAzOcHnWerREl678su-p0A,"Got sick from the food, as did my family. General Tso's Chicken was disgusting and didn't look cooked, also had horrible texture.

Delivery itself took over an hour to come. If you're looking for a date with your face in a toilet bowl all night, Asian Garden is your place.",chinese
269,1.0,qAzOcHnWerREl678su-p0A,"Let me just start out by saying that when my fiancé and I started dating 4 years ago, this was one of our absolute favorite lunch spots. It had these nice big booths, had a sushi bar and pop machine, was decorated appropriately, and the food was delicious. Then life happened, and we hadn't been in for a meal in quite some time... 

So my fiancé frequents the vape shop next door and needed to get juice. Neither of us felt like cooking so he suggested that we pack the kids up and head to Asian Garden since he was going to be right there anyways and we hadn't been in ages.

We enter the restaurant, and all of the booths have been removed. In their place we're a few flimsy mismatched plastic tables and chairs. The sushi bar? Vanished. Instead of having a pop fountain, there was a self-service cooler. Ok, I know this doesn't make for a bad experience in and of itself, but stick with me here.

We were asked to order at the counter before we sat, kind of like in a cafeteria. The food all came out rather quickly, which seemed a little odd considering past wait times. I had ordered the orange chicken, which was a favorite of mine when we went regularly, with a pork egg roll, fried rice, and hot and sour soup. The soup was bland, my egg roll had been fried to oblivion, my rice had a very plastic taste to it. My fiancé's meal fell right in line... Needless to say, we were quite disappointed.

Next time my family wants Chinese food, we'll take the $40 we spent on overcooked cafeteria food and set it directly on fire... Or just hit Rice Inn up the road.",chinese
270,1.0,qAzOcHnWerREl678su-p0A,Not good at all. Delivery took over an hour. General Tso's was mushy and tasted like ketchup over popcorn chicken. Fried rice was flavorless. This garden is full of manure.,chinese

273,2.0,_VYUU5HPLYasd-xdKLimNA,"Worst wonton soup I ever had. I didn't even think it was possible to mess up wonton soup. To illustrate, imagine dunking a plastic container in a toilet bowl, adding a pinch of salt, and two wontons (one without filling). No scallions. No flavor. Just bland yellow water and soggy falling apart wontons. I was so mad as I ate it, expecting it to get better somehow with each spoonful. It reminded me of hospital food or jail food or something, it was a sad experience.

The Hunan shrimp was blah too. There was, I believe, four shrimp in the dish. And sauce was kinda watery. The only good thing about this place was the vegetables weren't rotten, but one would expect that anyway. I wouldn't recommend eating here.",chinese
274,3.0,_VYUU5HPLYasd-xdKLimNA,"This is strictly a take out and delivery Chinese restaurant. There's no dining in the restaurant. 

I ordered dinner here and decided to try the General Tso chicken since it was favorably mentioned in other reviews. 

The menu is pretty standard Chinese fare with a few Thai dishes. 

I ordered in person instead of calling in the order. The lady at the counter was friendly. The food came out in about 10 minutes as she had stated it would.

They give you a large serving which was really enough for two people. This dish, which I don't think I've had before, consisted of deep fried pieces of breaded chicken that are soaked in a sauce, which was supposed to be spicy but to my tastes was more sweet than spicy. I'm not fond of sweet main courses so probably would try something different. It came with steamed rice, and thankfully they didn't give me an over generous quantity of the rice. 

This is a decent place if you're in the neighborhood and want Chinese take out. The price was about standard--$10.50 for the General Tso chicken.",chinese

They pack the aluminum to-go tray pretty heavily to ensure a healthy trip to the bathroom a few hours later. The storefront itself has a small amount of seating.

Good for a hangover; not so good for a client lunch. Still probably better than any quick options at the Dirty Bird next door. There are better alternatives on East Carson Street...but there's always a soft spot in my belly for some greasy 'n' cheap Chinese.",chinese

We love to get the egg rolls every time and occasionally get the pan fried dumplings which also never disappoint. The general tso's chicken is our favorite and is very good. I didn't like the general tso's shrimp or pepper steak as much. The portions are large and can be shared.

On top of the good food, the service is always super fast.  Tonight when I ordered takeout the food was ready in 10 minutes and was super fresh tasting.  

My go to here is the general tsos and the spring rolls.  The sauce they use in the general tsos is a perfect combination of spicy and sweet.  On top of that great sauce, the chicken is always crispy.  They give you big portions also, usually my wife and I will split one of the dishes.",chinese

295,3.0,eW6HLU-M3xJOpGyKLrWxUg,"This is a very decent take out Chinese and Thai restaurant. Although there are a few booths and tables, it's really more of a takeout place and the ambience doesn't lend itself to dining in. 

I decided to order the Mongolian Satay Beef since it was in the chef specialty list and also was had a positive mention in other reviews. I wanted some vegetables so I got broccoli in hot garlic sauce. The meal came with a very large portion of steamed white rice. 

My meal was good, not greasy or too salty and servings were plentiful. I wouldn't order the Mongolian Satay dish, though. Although it was posted as a spicy item, it didn't taste too spicy hot to me and there were too many onions and scallions for my taste. 

The broccoli was very good, cooked just right and tasty with the sauce. It would have been a full dinner to have just a large serving of the broccoli with rice. 

I'm not a fan of white rice. I'm not sure if they had brown rice but I didn't see it mentioned in the menu and I wasn't asked if I wanted brown or white. 

Service was friendly and it was about a 10 or 15 minute wait in the restaurant for my order to be ready. 

Prices are reasonable and they have a very large menu. I'd try this place again when I want some Chinese or Thai take out.",chinese
296,5.0,qh1GCWP_2TKxevp3ZeMxag,"For a strip mall Chinese restaurant, this goes well beyond what you would expect.  This place could definitely stand alone in a building that is for sure.  When you walk inside you are transported.  Like I said you would not expect this from a strip mall.  Inside there is a great design, feels like you are in an authentic Chinese building.

We were greeted swiftly and lead to a booth.  Handed menus and we were on our way to figure out what we wanted to eat.  Shortly after we started looking over the menu we were brought water and hot tea.  The tea is delicious and you can add what you like to sweeten it or go at it unsweetened.  Our service was outstanding the whole time we were here.  Every time our server came to the table there was a smile on her face, she was quite pleasant.

We went with Avocado Cheese Wontons as our appetizer.  Serving size here felt small, but we had to remember that it was an appetizer, not a full meal.  These wontons were amazing.  You got the cream cheese taste with just a hint of avocado, as well as the green tint.  Pair that with some duck sauce and they were a hit.

For my appetizer I went with Sweet and Sour Chicken.  I have not had this in a while and was craving it.  I was happy to have waited so long to have it again because this place did it justice.  The chicken came from breast meat.  The pieces were longer than you would think, but they were delicious.  The coating was great, held the sauce and stayed crispy.  Speaking of the sauce, loved it.  Nice and sweet with pieces of pineapple, red bell pepper, and onion in it as well.  I usually have leftovers when it comes to Chinese food, but not this time.  I ate every single bite of this meal.  So satisfying.",chinese

Ya Fei is located in the Robinson Town Center plaza and can be a little hard to locate because the storefront isn't huge or flashy. Having a baby this spring has made my boyfriend and I the biggest fans of takeout, so I haven't had the opportunity to sit down for a meal at Ya Fei yet. We've ordered takeout here more than a handful of times now, and I've never had a complaint. Our order is usually a combo of sushi and traditional Japanese food, but I always go for the sushi and it's always amazing!

My favorite roll is the crazy tuna roll. It has spicy tuna and asparagus on the inside, and seared tuna, avocado, and caviar on top. My boyfriend really liked the Submariner roll that he got last week. That one has several different fishes, cream cheese, eel sauce, and is tempura battered and fried to a nice crisp. I've always loved the freshness of their sushi and although it's a couple dollars more than surrounding restaurants I believe it's 100% worth every penny. Ya Fei's entrees have also never disappointed. I like the option to opt for all white meat chicken with their chicken entrees. Some of the entrees like the strawberry chicken sound really interesting and are definitely on my list to try when we order from here in the future.

Overall, Ya Fei is one of my favorite Asian dining options in the Robinson area. Service has always been quick and friendly, the food has been delicious every time, and it's definitely in a convenient area and would make the perfect lunch or dinner during a shopping trip!",chinese

Chicken was moist but the vegetables that are supposed to be in each dish were hard to find.  One of their specialties at over $13.00 wasn't very special.  I will say their ginger salad dressing was different and tasty.  I just don't think it's enough to get me back though.....darn it.,chinese
315,1.0,MwsGayIlUkXQ46mkmV3jlA,Wow and I am saying WOW! I'm sorry but the wok in heaven with the old owners was and I mean the best but now its a tragedy ... Food is bland either under or over cooked rice taste like ( no words had to use the emoji) they say they also offer delivery but never have some one to deliver please bring back the old owners their legacies are at stake.,chinese
316,4.0,o2UAUbXSNRrqleXtSMLniA,"I get to leave the first review! Hoorah!

I ordered delivery through grubhub and everything was great. Good, standard, tasty Chinese takeout. It came a little earlier than the estimated delivery time. Nice portions and decent prices!",chinese
317,1.0,o2UAUbXSNRrqleXtSMLniA,"Stay away. This is the worst Chinese food I've ever had in my life. Also very inconvenient to get to, I called ahead for pickup and then had lots of difficulty finding somewhere to park. Never again. I wish I could give it 0 stars.",chinese
318,1.0,o2UAUbXSNRrqleXtSMLniA,"This is by far the worst Chinese delivery I've ever had. 
I always leave detailed instructions for the driver, but it was very obvious that they did not read them. The driver called me and YELLED into the phone asking where I was. I repeated the instructions to get him where he needed to be, and we hung up. Five minutes later, he calls back and proceeds to YELL at me again, saying he's on the wrong side of the building than what I had just said. So I correct him again and we hang up. I go outside to wait.
The driver pulls up and yells over at me, you order food? So I approach the car, only to find two other people in there with him. Some guy in the back seat roughly grabs my bag of food and shoves it to the front. The driver then rudely asked me if the order was paid for. I said it was, the whole time wondering why he wouldn't know that.

As for the food, it was awful. I ordered coconut shrimp, general tso's chicken, and fried pork dumplings. The shrimp was beyond overcooked; it was chewy and soggy and overall flavorless. The chicken was similarly overcooked and soggy, and definitely not spicy like the menu said. The dumplings were also soggy and lacking flavor. To top it off, the food was barely even warm. It was completely inedible.

Do not order from this place! They hire crazy drivers and clearly can't cook food.",chinese
319,2.0,o2UAUbXSNRrqleXtSMLniA,"This was probably the worst Chinese food I've ever had. Spring rolls were salty and inedible and the vegetable lo mein had no flavor...just greasy noodles with very salty vegetables. The crab rangoon was good, but it was probably because it was literally just cream cheese in a wonton. Quick delivery, terrible food.",chinese

I just happened to be in this portion of the neighborhood and in need of food.  My better half had to keep reminding me about the food and I finally got it that we should really eat something.  This was literally the closest place to us, just a couple blocks away.

I decided to walk here, but I called ahead to place the order so that it may be ready when I get there.  I'm kind of glad I did it this way instead of having it delivered.  I got to see the inside of the place which gave me some interesting views.  You can definitely see that the inside is seriously underused.  Looks like it could do some ample business inside and appears to have the ability to have a small buffet, but does not utilize that.  It definitely has the Chinese restaurant feel, but no customers inside.

As for the food it was spot on.  Ready when I got there so with the short walk back it was piping hot.  Right type of spice for the General Tso and I really enjoyed the egg roll.  I definitely had a full belly after that meal.",chinese

I've seen workers smoking with their aprons on outside cleaning or fixing their cars and going back in to cook your food. They don't clean their kitchen properly and actually our whole strip was shut down for a day due to they way they are cleaning the grease traps. It smelled like doo doo at my job for a week.

We tried the hot and sour soup, the fried crab wontons, and the general tsos chicken.

The general tsos chicken was delicious. We got takeout and the chicken was still crispy whenever we got at home. This is one mark of a good general tsos chicken in my opinion. The crab wontons were equally delicious. Then again I've never had a bad crab wonton.

The hot and sour soup left something to be desired but maybe we just came on an off day we're haven't picked or flavor of soup that we like the best yet.

Will be excited to go back to this restaurant and visit them more often.",chinese

So finally got the chance to reserve for 5 PM on a Sunday - not busy but people were just starting  l swarm in . A small place indoors and a lot of tables outside which are a little cramped. The decor is nothing to boast about yet pleasant .
Now the food - the bread - you can even avoid it . Not worth it . 
The Penne in vodka sauce - flavorful , beautiful colors and top notch ! 
The special of the day - pork chops with a lot of veggies ( including sweet pepper) and sausage
- highlight of the day ! Very rich Tomato sauce - excellent sausage - the pork chops weren't cook f to perfection but nothing that cannot be overlooked

I also ordered the eggplant parm for my dinner and it had very little sauce on it that I had to ask for more. I will say that the tiramisu we had for dessert was fantastic though. Overall, we do enjoy the atmosphere and service provided by the restaurant- but agree that the food lacks flavor.",italian
332,2.0,PJ-l-Le8_I4nPomX18M2AQ,Visited here for a friends birthday dinner. Ambiance is nice and the restaurant has a fancy feel to it. Staff was friendly. This is my second time having dinner at Bravo and I really want to like it but the flavors have just been disappointing for me. We ordered the ravioli app and it was just okay. The dipping sauces tasted a bit odd to me and the raviolis weren't filled. Then we had the cheese dip appetizer that tasted very bland and had two pieces of bread with some apples. A bit lackluster. I did enjoy the lobster bisque soup. I thought it had a lot of great flavor. Unfortunately the lobster ravioli also lacked flavored and the raviolis didn't taste too much like lobster in my opinion.,italian
333,3.0,PJ-l-Le8_I4nPomX18M2AQ,"Very unimpressive. It was about what I expected from a chain Italian place. About the level of the other main cheap Italian chain. The wedding soup was decent, though they didn't use the correct pasta. The pesto was not very good at all. It tasted like a cross between good pesto and what I'd imagine sawdust would taste like. It was also COLD. It may have been heated at some point, but it wasn't even left under a heat lamp. If we hadn't been with another couple, I'd have sent it back. (I thought this was the reason it tasted really bland, but when I heated up the leftovers at home it was still very bad pesto.)

I'd definitely get something else if we ever go back there, but I hadn't been to that Bravo ever and I hadn't been to any Bravo in years, so I doubt we'll go back in the near future. 

The service was decent, the bread was great (seemed very fresh), and the wedding soup was okay, but I would definitely not recommend it. There are so many NON chain Italian restaurants and if you have to go with a chain, there are better chains, too.",italian

340,4.0,Ky0X7OLqSeBpvNNf0NjVcg,"If you've been to one Olive Garden, you've been to them all in my opinion. If you haven't been there, this is a chain restaurant which serves up many classic Italian dishes and more. 

Each meal is served with soup or endless bowl of salad. I highly recommend the salad which has their signature Olive Garden dressing topped with onions, tomatoes, black olives, croutons and pepperoncini. I've enjoyed many dishes and haven't had one I hate, however, the eggplant Parmesan is greasy in my opinion and I've had better elsewhere. They have great lunch options too which are lighter making overeating less likely! While I typically prefer a mom and pop non-chain restaurant. Olive Garden is a reliable choice which you can find in many cities and get a decent meal.",italian
341,1.0,Ky0X7OLqSeBpvNNf0NjVcg,"It saddens me to have to write this experience,  but this was one of the most horrible experiences I've had a Olive Garden.  We were celebrating my cousin's birthday, and he was so disappointed by the time we left.  We had a server, Tiffany, and she was not very attentive.  We had a party of 8, in which I didn't think it should have been as difficult as she made it.  The restaurant was not busy at all, and there were so many empty seats all around us.

When we were seated, our drink orders were taken and we decided to put in a few appetizers.  She wrote them down and came back 20 minutes later with only one drink!  Then she proceeded to take our dinner orders, and stated the drinks will be right up. 10 more minutes later she finally brought the other seven drinks.

We are sitting there hungry, waiting for soup/salad, apps or something, and then 20 minutes later she decided to bring our soups and salad.  It took almost an hour for soup and salad?!?  She never asked us for refills on the drinks, instead she brought a pitcher of pink lemonade, yet nobody ordered pink lemonade.  We just chalked it up and kept waiting.  So here we are, 1 hour 15 min later and finally the appetizers come out (only 3 lasagna frittas).  They were disappointing because they were not hot and the sauce started to settle and harden, which tells me they were done for a while sitting under a lamp, and then she finally decided to bring them to us.

So here we are 1 hour 40 minutes later and the entrees come out.  The mashed potatoes were cold, but the chicken was hot.  She brought another pitcher of pink lemonade, hence no drink refill order taken.  It was such a disappointing experience.

Finally, my family get their take home orders and they were were incorrect and overcharged, so she had to adjust the bill.  Finally  I think the worst is over and I'll avoid this place going forward, but I was wrong.

We split the check 3 ways among our party, and my card was charged twice.  I'm thinking my it just a hold and once it settles, it will fall off. -wrong.  First it was charged in the wrong amount (higher than what I signed for) and then it posted twice.  So now I'm out of almost $100 until the manager resolves this.  I called on Monday and it's now Friday and my money still has not returned.

Never again",italian

""Would you like some more iced tea?"" once or twice, would have been nice.

On to the food...
Salad was absolutely drenched in dressing.  Wilted lettuce swimming at the bottom of the bowl...so sad.
I ordered spaghetti and meatballs because I had a craving for Italian after checking out Alla Famiglia's menu.  Which I hope to get to next week.

The food Olive Garden was very disappointing.  The meatballs has some sort of crunch on the inside when I bit into them.  Not sure what that could be...maybe I don't want to know.  Also they were flavorless.  Spaghetti was just ok, but the marinara sauce was very watery and there wasn't enough of it.

359,5.0,FZpyIiCAsr7Twkw4tQeqPA,"I was greeted warmly at the front door and was told that we would be seated soon and I could go to the bar to wait. Um...Yes! I met up with some people at the bar and we ordered some drinks and started talking while we waited. 

Drink:
Long Island Limoncello: Caravella Limoncello adds an Italian twist to a classic - with New Amsterdam Vodka, rum and triple sec.
Um..This was great. It was not too sweet and had a nice punch of lemon that really made it something unique. I did not find it to be that usual, ""omg this is a long island I am going to be drunk"" type of drink. It was refreshing and not overbearing. 

Italian Margarita: Jimador Silver 100% blue agave tequila, triple sec and imported Italian amaretto. (ordered during dinner)
YUM! I liked this one better than the first! I do not even like tequila but this was superb. The little sidecar of amaretto also made the drink. I even went out and bought some amaretto to try to make this at home!

Appetizers:
Fried Mozzarella: 
While fried mozzarella is not a new thing the alfredo drizzle on the top was. I thought it was a nice touch. The mozzarella sticks had a light breading on them. I liked that but when you lifted them up to eat they sometimes fell apart. While gooey cheese dripping from your fork is never a bad thing, I wished that they held their shape a bit more to make it easier to eat. I also think that they always need to bring out more marinara sauce. Or make the sauce cup a different shape so it is easier to dip, dunk, and re-dip. 

Shrimp Fresco: 
This dish had a spicy kick at the end for sure! I was not really feeling it because of the coldness of the shrimp. I like shrimp cocktail but this shrimp was just not doing it for me. The rest of my table loved it so that was good! And the sauce that was on the side was really good too!

Mediterranean Flatbread: Basil pesto and olive oil, topped with a blend of four Italian cheeses, artichoke hearts, olives, capers, roasted red peppers and garlic.
I thought that this was really good. If you do not like olives do not order this dish!!! The bread was nice and crusty so it did not droop and with the amount of toppings it should have! This dish was loaded with goodness. I enjoyed it. 

Grilled Chicken and Cheese Piadina: 
Eh. Not that much of a fan.

Grilled Vegetable and Cheese Piadina: Tangy roasted red peppers, mushrooms, fresh spinach and a savory Italian cheese sauce seasoned with garlic, basil and sun-dried tomatoes. Served with a side of marinara.
This was a lot better than the chicken version. The vegetables were crisp and the basil and sun-dried tomatoes were great. Very yummy for sure. Again just a quesadilla and not that amazing but a lot better than the chicken.

Dinner Dishes:
Pot Pie Italiano Nonna's Kitchen Sink: 
Nope. 

Pot Pie Italiano Chicken and Broccoli: Comforting layers of baked cavatappi(corkscrew pasta), made-from-scratch Alfredo sauce, grilled chicken, broccoli and a blend of Italian cheeses baked inside a golden flaky pie crust.
This is the good stuff for sure. I liked this one 100 times better than the other pot pie. Yum. Yum. Yum. I called this as mine for the leftover since I enjoyed it so much! I think it was the alfredo sauce instead of the red that made it better. 

Chicken Parmigiana Breadstick Sandwich: Parmesan-breaded chicken breast, fried and topped with Italian cheeses and marinara. 
I love chicken parm so this was one of my favorite dishes of the night. The chicken was fried to perfection and the breadstick as the sandwich!!!! PERFECTION. The only suggestion I had was having a side dipper of sauce so you could dip the sandwich in it. I like to dip so that the bread doesn't get really soggy from the sauce sitting on the bread. But that is just me. I made that suggestion for sure that night. More sauce please! 

Shrimp Scampi: Shrimp sautéed in a garlic sauce, tossed with asparagus, tomatoes, and angel hair pasta.
I also called this for left overs. The asparagus and tomatoes with the light sauce, perfection. Just enough shrimp to make the dish feel full but not overwhelming. I would get this again, and again, and again......

Chicken Piccata: Grilled chicken topped with a lemon garlic butter sauce, sundried tomatoes and capers. Served with parmesan-crusted zucchini.

I would also get this again! I also took it for leftovers and ate it the next day and enjoyed it just as much. The sauce! Dang, that lemon garlic butter sauce was good! I don't even like capers and thought I would hate this dish, boy was I wrong!

Northern Tour of Italy: 
Did not like this. 

Dessert:
Sicilian Cheesecake: Our ricotta cheesecake features a shortbread cookie crust and is topped with seasonal strawberry sauce.
GET THIS AGAIN! I took it home with me and ate it the next day. OMG. Ricotta cheesecake for the win. It was great. I wished there were more berry sauce on it, but it was still good. 

Coffee:
Almond Cappuccino
Drank this the next day cold, damn, it was good!

Awesome night!",italian

Doors to the outside were open to allow the fresh air in, unfortunately cigarette smoke from outside the door was blowing back into our dining area.

It looked so cute with all the lights and it's perfect for rainy days because there's a roof! The outdoor bar is amazing. The bartender and head chef is so friendly. He even served us our food himself. The menu isn't huge but the prices make it worth it. They don't have a parking lot but there are usually tons of spot on the nearby streets to park. No matter what day or time you go, you can be seated immediately and your food/drinks come out super quick. Definitely go in the summer to take advantage of the outdoor patio! Reason for 3 stars? Although I loved the outdoor area, the inside didn't really seem like it had been kept up to date. You can also smoke there so I wasn't a huge fan of that. The food isn't the best quality but it's good. Not a place I would recommend for a nice night out but great if you're stopping by for a drink.",italian

We had to track the waitress down to find out where our food was, when she finally brought it out it was cold.
When we told another server about it, her answer was well we're very busy. People at tables around us left because their food was taking too long to eat and get to the theater. We passed another couple sitting in a pizza restaurant and two other tables took their food to go.
The only reason we went was because they were near the theater. I would recommend that people not go",italian

It's largely unchanged over that span, with the same decor, menu, and wine list. The menu is Italian and limited, with a few simple meat and pasta choices, a couple of soup and salad offerings, and a limited but adequate wine list. Prices are kind of mid-level and service is usually prompt. The food is unremarkable, but up to the unchallenging standards of a corporate restaurant. Overall it's a safe choice if you're looking for basic, but not quite authentic, Italian food. With no authentic Italian competition in the suburbs, Bravo fills the void. I guess you could call that faint praise, but so what, at Bravo there is also little to criticize.",italian

It was perfect.  From the planning phase, to day of, everyone was so nice to work with here.  Alan was excellent to work with from the beginning.  He made sure every question was answered.  The only other hiccup we had was that they forget the hot sausage as the third entrée.  They ended up bringing it out 15 minutes after the food was ready and even took it off our bill.   Everyone at Pugliano's was so helpful and accommodating .  I would not hesitate to have a party here again.

The wife got a Pittsburgh sammy which she said was very good. 
The kid scarfed on a pepperoni pizza and I stole a piece, it was okay at best.

375,4.0,sMJAUZNU6u4iNvpmaLgx_g,"We started thinking that we were going to try for just appetizers, and base whether we were going to expand off of it. 

The atmosphere of the place is interesting. I believe it needs to be redone to have a better use of the space. There are three speakers for the music to come out, and they are in a couple of instances, placed too close to the HVAC vents, so it causes bouncing. The lighting is as inconsistent as the artwork, and there's no real reason to put a vespa into a restaurant that is trying to be more on the upscale side of things.

The burrata and the octopus were off the charts good. Both were as close to perfect as I have had. Based on that, we ordered the gnocchi. Portion wise, it was good enough to share based on the double appetizer. It was just OK... when it came out, it was presented to us; however, we had to ask for Parmesan. The sauce was inconsistent in that it was a bit ""watery"" and had places where the acidity spiked. The gnocchi, itself was good; however, blending in a little something would have made it more upscale. The brisket was more of a pulled beef that one would expect in a stew, and not as advertised on the menu. I would have chunked the brisket, and taken advantage of the serving plates, and put it under a broiler after adding some cheese to give it a bit of a crust.",italian
376,3.0,sMJAUZNU6u4iNvpmaLgx_g,"My friends and I stumbled into Talia after a Riverhounds game.  They were accommodating with our casual dress and hunger for something other than stadium food.

The fall cocktails here were delightful.  In fact, I would opine that this might be one of the better casual cocktail bars downtown.  Our server was fun, playful, and attentive.  The food was alright.  We started out with the brussel sprouts.  Full disclosure, I effing love me roasted sprouts with pancetta, and parmesan.  This dish was lacking in my mind.  The pancetta seemed to be absent or underrepresented, which meant the dish was lacking serious salt flavor that compliment sprouts.  The garlic cream was good but again didn't accent the sprouts in a way to make them live up to my expectation.

My friends split the risotto and loved it.  I had a bite and didn't think it was creamy enough for my palate, and I wanted more wine flavor to come through.  I had the gnocci with the brisket on the side (so that a vegetarian friend of mine could try it).  The gnocci was not the delightful cloud of air that I have come to expect from homemade gnocci, but the pomodoro was so good.  The first bite that I had (sans brisket) had the sweet and strong flavors of basil in beautiful balance. My friends agreed.  Then I added the brisket to the dish so that I could finish my meal.  Mistakes.  The brisket was good, but it overpowered the beauty of the pomodoro.  Perhaps this was my fault for the brisket on the side, but I was sad and regretted the remainder of my meal.

My three star rating is one that will have me return if I find myself there or with people that want to go, but seek it out, I will not.",italian

We went with a cheese plate which is pretty basic but I was not overly impressed. The cheeses were all a bit strong for my liking and the crostini a bit burnt. We ordered a side of bread because the crostini's weren't great and the bread was SO GOOD! I asked what the delicious dip that came with it was, and it was just salted butter! It was the creamiest butter I've ever had.

Overall, a nice place to stop. I would maybe come back for dinner however nothing on the menu really struck my eye.",italian

380,4.0,XXsZUNkdGxy_0_Jy4AYLhg,"I'm never in the area and took advantage of being around here for lunch to check this place out. It is absolutely beautiful inside. It's modern with a sort of rustic edge. I think a dinner date here would be perfect. There's even a little nook/bar area that would be great for that or drinks with friends. 

For lunch they have a small sheet with only a handful of specials and then you can get half or full portions of pasta for lunch. You can also order off what looks to be the main course/dinner menu too. 

I'm glad that was an option because I was disappointed to learn they don't offer any gluten free pasta. I've found that a lot of pasta spots around town offer GF pasta like DiAnoias, who definitely take their pasta seriously. I totally get you make your pasta in house and you can't make GF pasta fresh daily, but pasta dishes are delicious with GF pasta and the right sauce and ingredients. I'd love to have the chance to try a pasta dish here at some point and would strongly suggest it!

So, again, good thing I could order off the main course/dinner menu and got the chicken and subbed in the squash risotto instead of the potatoes since they were fried. I'm glad they could make that swap for me. I was even more grateful when I tried the risotto, which was some of the best I have ever had. I seriously could have licked the plate, it was incredible. The chicken was also cooked perfectly, and I rarely order chicken in restaurants because it's usually dry and tasteless. 

I will also say I appreciate that they offer house sparkling water! Service was friendly and prompt and I'd love to visit again if in the area and if they start offering GF pasta!",italian

Salads tasted good but extremely simple. Didn't feel like fresh simple ingredients for the sake of fresh simple ingredients, felt like it might have been a money saving thing. Some additional toppings would have been justified for the price and location alongside a strip mall. 

Willing to give it another try during dinner, impressed with the service and interesting looking pasta dishes, just fence sitting re: price.",italian

Note that they do require a credit card to make a reservation, which, while it wasn't a problem for us being so last minute, could be a problem if you did need to cancel. 

When we entered the restaurant, I was surprised to see that we were seriously the youngest diner there by about thirty years! I didn't see one other person our age. I understand that the restaurant is a little removed from the city, but if you're looking at all of a younger, hip vibe, this is not the place for you.

It took a while for us to get our drinks, but the waitress was aware of the backup at the bar and did apologize about it. Not her fault! I got the grapefruit basil margarita, and while I considered it a solid margarita overall, it was lacking in the actual grapefruit and basil flavors. I would have gotten a different drink knowing that. For dinner, our table all ordered the smaller plates of pasta so we could taste more options. They were tasty, but nobody was blown away. In fact, just a few days prior to going here, I was at DiAnoia's (it was my birthday week hehe!) and their food was a lot tastier in my opinion. I had the cacio e pepe dish at both restaurants and the DiAnoia's dish won hands down. 

Overall, the restaurant felt like a good option if you're looking for something outside the city, but it wasn't exactly my vibe and I've had better Italian here in Pittsburgh!",italian

I ordered a cauliflower/brussel sprout dish that had a strong smoked flavor. I enjoyed it and think it's pretty unique. I honestly couldn't tell what the very strongest flavor was, though. Almost like a vinegar taste but not quite. For my entree I ordered the rigatoni. Very simple but pleasant. The table bread was also very tasty.

Tonight, we went here on a whim, and I am so very pleased we did. As far as the service goes, we were greeted kindly by the hosts, the bartenders as we waited for a table ( very busy on a Thursday night- good sign!) , and our lovely server Carole. Very down to earth people working here but also professional and everyone seemed very happy to be at work in this fine place! While we waited, i ""spotted"" a dish on a nearby table that looked like a delicately breaded something or other that just looked delicious whatever it was I was looking at. When we got seated I asked our waitress what I saw on that table, as it looked so beautifully cooked and good, and she said it was the Spots with lump crab on top. After much deliberation, I just couldn't pass up this dish- even though I've never had spots in my life and didn't know what to expect, I took the risk of ordering something new.. and I'm very happy to say I've found my new favorite dish at a new favorite restaurant in the south hills. I may get this ever time we come here, which will be often! Outstanding dinner for a random Thursday night out! Glad we stumbled upon DeLallo's!

The fish was great, but the sweet potatoes were just blahhhh. They weren't cooked all the way through and weren't seasoned enough. My husband got the spaghetti and meatballs and really enjoyed his meal. We split the peanut butter pie (again made in house) and both loved it. I would love to try the tiramisu next time!

My favorite, though, is the Broiled Spots. Maybe I haven't been to enough Italian restaurants, but I've never seen spots on the menu at any other place. It's a delicate white fish that is served in a buttery sauce and topped with crispy panko bread crumbs. So so good. Another tasty dish is the Pasta Farlenese, which has a tomato cream sauce. We've also tried the homemade ravioli and while they were ok, probably not the best I've tried. The dough seemed a little tough, but maybe it was just my batch? But their sauce served with it was pretty good.

391,3.0,SpQNr_ybDkzHuSYskKUpeA,"We'd had high hopes for this place but were left rather disappointed. First off when I made our reservation, supposedly 6:15 was the only time available; however, when we left around 7:45, there were at least 4 empty tables. We would have preferred a later time but wanted to try this place. Additionally, when we arrived, we'd asked to be sat in the corner away from the front door as it was a cold night. The hostess said that table was reserved but of course no one sat there the entire evening and was left vacant when we left as well. Please note that every time the door opened a blast of cold air would rush in. That added to the less then stellar night out.

So for our meals, we both ordered pasta that was reasonably priced ($19) but wasn't anything either of us would order again. The entrees are way overpriced for an eatery in a more or less medical/office building. I'd expect to pay $37 for an entree downtown or a higher end suburban restaurant which is what I presume this place is trying to be. I assure you it is not!

The liquor menu is very limited as well.

To survive reasonably priced items are needed, a friendlier hostess and better trained wait staff. While our server was very nice and attentive she never asked why we didn't eat the bread pudding we'd ordered. It was bland and hard. The ice cream I'd ordered with a fancy name (smoked bourbon maple ice cream) was nothing more then a scoop of maple ice cream in a small bowl.

So while I wouldn't say don't try this place, just go expecting to pay a hefty sum for a mediocre dinner and bring a blanket if you're there on a colder evening! 

I hope this place becomes a neighbor gem once they work out the kinks.",italian

As for the food the results were mostly good. Caesar and commons salads were large fresh and tasty but wedding soup looked a bit unusual especially when served in a large glass coffee mug. The meatball appetizer of three small meatballs was hardly worth $13!
The veal saltimbocca entree was large and tender and came with tasty creamy polenta. But it was a bit steep at $32. A pasta goody dish was spicy and tasty. We skipped dessert.

To start our meal our party ordered salads and received all but one, a Caesar salad.  After asking about it twice we received our main courses so we cancelled the salad.
The main course portions seemed to be smaller than advertised and smaller than other diners around us...a legitimate complaint given the prices being charged.  When this issue was brought to the attention of the server our complaint was summarily dismissed.

Still, I decided it was time so we popped in one late afternoon/early Sunday evening. Despite the time and the lack of a crowd, we still waited a lot for just about everything.  

The menu excited us. There seemed to be a decent amount of options. I have to admit, though, I am always annoyed when $20+ pasta dishes do not come with salad. First real strike. Oddly though, they came with a side of vegetables, which we never received. By this point, we didn't want to wait longer. 

The waiter was friendly, but clearly distracted. I'm pretty forgiving of kind waitstaff, even if they are forgetful or clumsy. He never did bring our refills or check on us after bringing the food. We had to wave someone down every time... and there weren't many people around. The last straw was not bringing us our boxes (and this was the owner/manager, at this point). We had to find someone up front for those. Never any apologies for any of it. 

I almost forgot to mention the bug/gnat issue. What can I say? It was annoying, at best. They were flying about and landing on our table. My mom spent half of the time swatting in front of her face. It made me feel bad for bringing her, to be honest. 

All that to say, the food was pretty good. The breaded zucchini (appetizer) was the tastiest, reminiscent of The Italian Oven--if you remember that spot. For the price, coupled with the service, I left unsatisfied with the experience. The food might've tasted better if the experience was better, you know? I always say customer service colors everything. This was very true in this case.",italian

My friend and I love to try new places (for one of us) restaurants.  She was looking for a place on the east area of town for Restaurant week - when i suggested Roman Bistro.  While I had been there a few times - she had not.  

We both ordered from the restaurant week menu while her 3 children ordered off the regular menu.  While 2 of the kids were disappointed with the size of the kids portion flatbread - they were all very pleased with their food.  

My friend and i LOVED our food.  The portions were large (i took a bit home from each course!) and scrumptious  (they were also scrumptious the next day!)

While I have had not so hot experiences at Roman Bistro (I just couldn't bring myself to give them 5 stars) - I still enjoy it and keep going back.  It is good food :)",italian

404,5.0,wp5FAtCGMyU2RnQ-7kxKHQ,"It's probably about time I've written something about Roman Bistro since I've lived in the area for about five years and have been here numerous times. They're definitely on my short list for favorite Italian places in Pittsburgh.

I've never had an issue with the service. The place is a mix of casual and mildly upscale, so you could bring your family here or a date and not really feel out of place either way. They have a phenomenal selection of wine and beer.  There are happy hour specials and a build your own pasta night. Cigars are available for purchase but I'm genuinely unclear if you can actually smoke them anywhere on the premises. Maybe outside on the patio?

The food is very good and some of the pastas have different prices for lunch and dinner portions. The Tortellacci is one of my go-to dishes. Last time I had the Buccatini Amatriciana which was fantastic. I ordered the Roman Bistro club once for lunch and it took me two meals to finish it. The only thing I'm not real crazy about is the weekend brunch, which fills up very quickly and is just a simple buffet style. I'll eat it, but there are other places I'd rather go.

I'm probably overthinking this, but this is one of those times when I'm torn between four or five stars. As I said the brunch doesn't really win me over. Pricing sometimes feels a touch too expensive for me for a place that isn't as distinctively formal as some other Italian restaurants. Overall though I like the food enough and there's enough aspects worth giving them the benefit of the doubt.",italian

He said they would send it out right away. 30 minutes from then, still no pizza. The delivery guy called us lost, even though we live on a main road. We had to give him directions and I guess wasn't using a GPS.

When the food came what my wife got was chicken Romano.
My wife told the server and she said she would correct the mistake, but when the fish came she told my wife to scrape the rice off her chicken and put it on the fish. My chicken was correct but tasted like old tainted chicken. (Did not eat it all) When the check came I say a $4 charge for my cup of soup. I asked the server and she said ""that's the way it is""

In recent years the Italian side of the family has scattered a bit with people moving, which left a huge hole in my life as far as Italian food goes. Buca fixed that.

I know it's a chain, but it's the best chain out there, and I truly enjoy the food more than even many of the small Italian joints in Pittsburgh. The food at Buca is truly like my family used to make. I've loved everything I have ever ordered from Buca, period. And the atmosphere is like being back in my grandma's dining room.

My favorite thing on the menu is the baked ziti. It used to come with giant dollops of ricotta cheese on top, but last time I went to Buca I was dismayed to find my ziti came out of the kitchen ricotta free. The menu item has apparently been changed to not include it, but I highly recommend. Order the baked ziti with ricotta on top. And cannoli for dessert. You won't regret it!!",italian

If you want a starter, the antipasto salad is incredible and refreshing to prepare you for the large amount of carbs you're about to eat. If you save room at the end of your entrees, they also have great desserts. The Colossal Brownie Sundae is a dream come true. It is giant. Massive scoops of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, multiple chocolate chip brownies mixed in, and a tower of whipped cream and hot fudge on top.

Bravo used to be my JAM back in college. I actually preferred it over Olive Garden. I thought their dishes had more flavor and I liked the environment more. 

Now that I've frequented so many awesome local businesses over the years doing killer dishes, the place just feels different now. But when you're in the Galleria and have a screaming toddler in tow, this just works. 

So I just wish the bolognese would have had more flavor. It definitely lacked much of anything and I was definitely hungry shortly after I ate it because the meat portion wasn't very big either. Plus, no carrots in the bolognese? I thought that was part of the authentic dish? 

Service was also spotty. Our server didn't come back with our first drink order for a while. We had to ask for them actually. Then my husband needed a fork after we were served our main dishes, and the server said okay, then immediately went to the computer to put in an order. Maybe five minutes later I saw him out of the corner of my eye walk over to get a fork, but my husband had already gone to another table and grabbed his own fork at that point.

The service on the other hand was disappointing. While our servers were very nice, and probably overwhelmed on a Friday night, there were a several things that hindered my experience.

It took a while for our drinks to come, my friend's was the wrong one and we had to ask about my friend's beer 2 times before she told us they were out and another would have to be ordered.

The front of the building reminded me of an old ""family owned"" styled restaurant with a large canopy across the length of the restaurant and the name printed on the canopy. 

We were greeted by the hostess and seated right away. Again, the set up and style took me back to any family owned restaurant I have been to in the past. Wooden furniture, white tablecloths, booths lining the perimeter, and large pictures hanging on the walls. The aroma of pizza and hearty Italian food immediately permeated my senses! It smelled wonderful. 

The menu was large, with quite a variety of Italian dishes, from casual to more formal. Chicken, Seafood, Veal, and Steak to Pasta, Pizza, Sandwiches, Salads, and Calzones. I was craving pasta but was looking for a lighter option and sure enough, it was there! I ordered the Linguine Antonietta, a linguine based dish with roasted broccoli, zucchini, onions, carrots, and mushrooms with an oil based coating. I really enjoyed it however would have loved the addition of more vegetables (with a little less pasta) and some grilled chicken for protein! All dinners were served with a choice of soup, side salad, or vegetable and Italian bread. The side salad was basic with tomatoes, black olives and white onions on a bed of lettuce. I ordered their homemade Italian dressing and it was pretty tasty. The bread could have been much warmer and the butter was really cold, making it hard to spread.

The price of the dinners were mostly between $15-$20 which seemed to me to be on the higher side. However, there was some value as you get the soup/salad option before your meal and a loaf of bread to share among the table. Our waitress was very nice and helpful when we had questions about the menu and was very quick to fill our waters.

My wife and I were seated fairly quickly upon arriving. The inside had the feel and decoration of an Italian restaurant. The decoration seemed a bit dated and the layout was a little odd. There were two levels with the lower level having tables fairly close together and the upper level having all the lights turned off. On the lower level I could pretty much hear everyone's conversation so don't come here hoping for any privacy. 

I ended up ordering the pasta diavolo. It is a spicy dish with sausage and peppers. Our order came with soup or salad. Both my wife and ordered the salad with house made Italian dressing. The salad was nothing fancy with just some onion, tomato, and olives. An Ok salad with good dressing. The pasta was decent as well. It had a good heat level and the sausage was the star of the dish. 

I think the pasta here is solid and just the right amount for dinner, but the restaurant is a little outdated and I wouldn't consider the bathroom clean when I used it.

Drinks were reasonably priced, and she did a great job keeping up even though the bar area was slammed for the game. Appetizers were.. awesome! cheese wheel, yum - marinara sauce that they serve was wonderful as well. Fried zucchini was the biggest portion I've ever seen.

I will definitely be back here! Can't wait to check out more of their food.",italian

I was drawn to Buffalo Blue and Hot garlic parm. The only knock I have is the time it took for the wings to come out. The place didn't seem that crowded, but my group was in the back area. 

After the first bite I understood why it took so long. These bad boys were fried to perfection. (I like mine crunchy) Great ratio of flats to drums. Flavors I picked were incredible.",italian
451,5.0,497iuIdzSZqEVZ_iTnp-Jg,"This might be my favorite local restaurant. Their cheese wheel and fries are a go to every time we come. Monday is wing night and their wing sauce is slightly spicier than Frank's Red Hot and has really good flavor. I just tried the calzone and it is flavorful and a great value for the money. It is easily two meals.

The carpets were disgusting and looked like they hadn't been cleaned in years. I will never go here again, please don't waste your time.

I went in with a table of 6 and immediately fell in love with the nostalgic authentic vibe.  This restaurant feels like it's owned by a family or hardworking individual who has run it for years and years.  It didn't feel like a chain or like they were trying to trip up their customers with the promise of a great atmosphere.  The food spoke for itself.  I ordered the angel hair pasta with meatballs and my only regret is that I didn't ask for an order with two sides of meatballs - I though they were that good.  I would definitely come by again.",italian

The Chicken Marsala, Roast Beef, Rigatoni and more was perfectly cooked. The attention to details and service was great.  The staff were super friendly and Tony Lombardozzi was a true true professional working through the (sometimes picky) needs of our group.

For my lunch, I ordered a chicken ceasar salad and my fiancé ordered a fish sandwich. Everything was good! We had good service. The ambiance was chill.

While the bar area is very loud, our party was seated together in a quiet side dining room. Our waitress was pleasant and knowledgeable. And the kitchen can be very quick. FYI, they can't split checks for larger groups.

Now for the food. The Pleasure Bar house salad puts other restaurants' house salads to shame: mixed greens, pickled red pepper, pine nuts, mozzarella cheese, and not one but two kinds of olives. Classy. The kalamari came out hot, with a light breading and chewy center. All of the various pasta dishes we ordered were delicious, and generous servings. It's a good price if you count the leftovers.

I was pleasantly surprised and want to come back.",italian
463,4.0,RC8NJlX3X2Eo240PU5zJWA,"Since moving to Bloomfield, this restaurant has become a staple in our dinner routine. However, we are creatures of habit and have only gotten two things on the menu :D but also that is a testament to how good the dishes are! We always get the Penne Christopher and the Carbonara with wedding soup as the appetizers. The portions are HUGE, and you get an soup or salad and bread! I can get 3 meals out of mine, and my boyfriend can get 2. Three meals for less than 15$??? You can see why its a staple. During Little Italy days, I've also had, and loved, their hot sausage sandwich! The staff have always been polite and helpful, and super busy, so getting their attention took effort. A minor inconvenience as you're stuffing your mouth with pasta.",italian
464,4.0,j54J0Ky4ruVbN_NTJ3daFg,"Girasole is an experience and ultimately m, it's worth it. The place is very small and very popular which makes things hectic, especially on the weekends. Reservations generally don't stand for much on a Friday/Saturday as much as the time you check in, so if you want to walk right in I'd suggest going early or around 9pm (or a weeknight). 

That all being said, the food is tremendous and is worth the hassle of sometimes waiting outside for an hour plus. The spinach ricotta ravioli and gnocchi are both great and served year round. The gnocchi is light and satisfying and the sauce for the ravioli is very good. All entrees are served with either a house salad or a cup of the soup of the day. I always get the antipasto tray for to split as an appetizer. It varies, but generally has a couple meats and cheeses, and a combination of olives, artichokes, and sun dried tomatoes. Everything is obviously great with wine and the pours are quite generous. 

The specials are always good, and if you're a pumpkin person, the pumpkin ravioli is a must have fall meal. It is cooked in a sage butter sauce with nuts and little pieces of bacon. 

The cherry cheesecake is out of this world. It may be the best cheesecake in the city. It is light and the cherries are rich and sweet.",italian
465,1.0,j54J0Ky4ruVbN_NTJ3daFg,"It's unfair to give this establishment a one star, but a one star I must. Why? not because of the food, we ate there once and I don't recall anything not tasting fine. But we tried to eat there for a second time, with a reservation mind you, but we might as well not had one, because not only we waited, we were eventually relegated to the kitchen table in the back hallway where there is no space and noisy as hell and impossible to enjoy a fine dining experience. Please understand that we have experienced fine dining in some of the best restaurants in the country!

This brings me to the reason why this establishment deserves a one rating, failure to fix an ongoing issue that is crystal clear in the unsatisfied category of reviews in yelp. What this restaurant has going for it, it's a small fish in a pond, thus it has few to little competition, if it were in a big city like NY, LA or SF it would not survive the mismanagement. That being the failure to either expand the restaurant or restrict reservations by limiting the number of guests and not having to pinball clients to either ignore reservations or placement just because of the size of the establishment. Ignoring committed reservations is fatal and placement in less than desirable space speaks poorly of management.

I have seen and even met the owner and he is an absolutely amazing and delightful person, though the difficulty to keep everyone happy has perhaps impacted his demeanor in a negative way at times. He has built an amazing restaurant but he is going to lose a few clients here and there because he may not care to correct an obvious recurring issue! Lack of space. Best Wishes!",italian

There are some staple items on the menu that make the trip here worthwhile. It's not a huge menu, but you'll love it.

Despite having an actual reservation, there was no accountability at all and we even walked along Walnut street to find a new place given how rude the Host was and how long it was taking for him to randomly assign people waiting to tables. The bread at the table was cold and tasted store bought. All of the food was incredibly mediocre. The meatballs were extremely standard with nothing interesting or worth ordering again. The linguine with clam was completely tasteless. There were barely any clams. The only saving grace is the dessert at this place. Would not go back again.",italian

We were seated in the back dining room. It's a flashback to the past in a comforting way, with Fiesta plates. We ask for the drink menu and see a variety of wine and beer options. The wines don't list the vineyards, so it was difficult to discern. The beers included a good number of local crafts.

The specials include entrees and salad or dessert. It was a bit more food than we wanted, so we opted for the traditional menu. The seafood Devonshire caught my eye as did the veal diablo. Hubs was curious about the make your own pasta but at the mentioned of the veal diablo and options paralysis, he knew what he wanted.

We ordered and the waitress was helpful with the wine selection, noting the Chanti hubs ordered was on the sweet side, so he was able to swap it out for the dryer option. The food comes out within a reasonable time and it piping hot. The waitress realize she forgot our bread and brings it out, very much needed with the amount of sauce in out entrees. The veal diablo is delicious. I took a bite and was wowed by the spicy flavor. The seafood Devonshire is creamy and rich. The tart/pie crust was fluffy. The crab meat is imitation, so keep that in mind.

The service was excellent!  We were greeted in a warm and friendly manner and our waitress was spectacular.  She was on the ball, checking in, offered good recommendations.  

The place is a little dated and could use and update.  

The food was very good.  We had fried zucchini which I really didn't care for.  The breading was too much.  My daughter had their chicken fingers and French fries (I know who goes to an Italian place and orders that?!).  They were delish.  The fries rivaled Kennywood's fries in terms of taste.  My wife had the veal parmigiana which the veal size was humongous.  I had ravioli.  Their sauce was awesome - it's flavorful and hearty.  The ravioli were quite tasty.  In fact we left with so much food that we are enjoying the left overs two days later.  The chicken fingers have made it to lunch for two days as well.  


For dessert we had chocolate cake and carrot cake - the carrot cake was lacking and I'll never have it again.  But the chocolate cake was spectacular.  

I can not wait to come back to this place!",italian
476,3.0,4GUXkFjJL5SEZK-qtDZSKA,"So far, so good.  I've only been once.  I'll go again and post an update.

The food is decent.  I like the house salad (fresh, has more than just lettuce and a cherry tomato).  The table bread (slices of white, Italian bread) is fresh and soft and tasty, and the dipping sauce (balsamic and olive oil) is good.

My pasta dish was good but not amazing by any stretch.  The noodles were a touch overcooked, but not bad.  The marinara sauce, a staple of any good Italian restaurant, was a little disappointing.  It was too sweet for my taste.  I assume it's house-made, so maybe this varies by batch-of-tomatoes, so I'm willing to give it another try.

The service was good and met my expectation for a sit-down restaurant of this price point.  Overall, I had a good experience that matches Yelp's description of 3-stars.

They give you fresh bread and the dipping oil is their own recipe and it's great. You can use butter if you want it instead. The portions are very large. The veal piacquadio was excellent. My son had the chicken Marsala. The sauce was delicious. All meals come with a soup or salad and a side of veggies or a side of pasta. The pasta sauce was very good and homemade.

Everything on the menu looked delicious! I enjoyed the chicken, but I do think it could have had a bit more lemon flavor. Next time I will probably get the parm. The meatballs were fantastic! I almost forgot we had wedding soup (how could I do that haha) it was some of the best I have ever had. Amazing! Don't pass that up.

My husband raved about their gnocchi, and it's honestly the only thing we order from there. The gnocchi is delicious and I will add grilled chicken to mine most times! The only concern I have is half the time we order we get a tiny portion, and half the time it seems like a normal portion.. Their prices aren't that low that a portion should be as small as we get sometimes, so it has made me not really want to keep going there to maybe waste my money and be left hungry.

489,5.0,M49CwslHLTt9verCZhWxrg,"Storms on a Cloudy Day was Pure Sunshine 

11 months ago, a group of my friends and I decided we needed to spend more time together.  Our busy lives demanded that we connect more with each other to make it through.  ""Ladies who Lunch"" was born.  Once a month, normally on Thursdays we pick a restaurant that we have either wanted to try or want each other to try and spend an hour or two enjoying food, laughter and each other.  October's choice was Storms and it did NOT disappoint.  

The moment you walk into the unassuming Italian restaurant you are transported to an upscale but friendly surrounding.  A few dozen tables with elegant black tablecloths, side plates and clear glasses sat among beautiful gray toned, gold accented photos of Downtown Pittsburgh on their wall.  (I came to find out they were originally located downtown for 10 years and moved here in 2018).  Greeted by our waitress and a bottle of water she explained the daily specials and gave us some time to decide.  That was no easy task as everything on the menu sounded good.  

We started with their Crispy Fried Brussel Sprouts appetizer.  It was good and that plate went back completely bare.  The perfect sprout spheres were dressed in sea salt, cracked black pepper, balsamic glaze and large Reggiano Parmesan ribbons covered the top.  I would order these again.
The soup of the day was a Shrimp and Chorizo stew.  I had to try it and it was fantastic.  The spice of the chorizo mellowed out in the creamy broth packed with corn, carrots and perfectly cooked potato cubes.  The baby shrimp were amazingly tender and not overcooked - not an easy task when put in soup.

For the main course, two of my friends ordered the daily special of Chicken Cinzano.  It was three perfectly pounded out chicken breasts in a balsamic, white wine, butter and cream sauce.  The flavor was like a rich and hearty.  It could have used a side of pasta. I was surprised it did not come with one perhaps because it was lunch, but the rustic Italian bread our server brought was a perfect vehicle to enjoy every drop of sauce on the plate.  I ordered the Chicken Picatta which was also perfectly pounded out to tender deliciousness with sautéed mushrooms, artichokes, a heap of capers in a tasty lemon white wine sauce.  Again, a side of pasta would have made it better, but bread worked for me too.  Our other friend went for the Eggplant Parmesan which was a heaping serving with generous amounts of mozzarella cheese and a very unique spicy portabella mushroom sauce.  There were large chunks of mushrooms that made this meatless dish very filling and satisfying.  I love that all my friends willingly let me stick my fork in their lunch so I could try each dish. I would recommend all three.   

We were also celebrating my friend's birthday and the restaurant permitted us to bring in our own cake.  At the end of the meal, without me even having to ask again, our server plated the cake for me and brought it out with a lit candle, very nice touch!  We decided to order coffees to enjoy with the cake and that was smart.  The coffee was a clean and simple medium roast that I could drink carafe after carafe of. 

I can't wait to bring more friends and family to this terrific little restaurant which is right in my own backyard.  Well done, Storms.  I can't wait to come back and try your stuffed peppers and homemade wedding soup!  Grazie!",italian

The menu has a list of daily $10 specials. I opted for the one cheese slice, two meatballs and can of soda. Kind of a weird combo but what the heck. The slice is New York style and tastes decent. The meatballs are homemade in a homemade sauce. The meatballs could use a tad more flavor and the sauce was a bit tangy. As you can imagine this combo is a lot of food. I ate half the slice and one meatball.
I'll have lunch tomorrow as I don't want it to go to waste.
On the fence about being a repeat customer.",italian
497,5.0,-Sqfd4x8mi4ngwUpUB5nJw,Sad this place only has one review. The men making the pizzas are straight from Italy. I'm a bit of an oddball because I can't eat cheese but I love pizza so I order all my pizzas without cheese. These guys didn't seem to like that idea but with some convincing they decided to make my cheese less pizza... and OMG it was f*cking amazing!!! Obviously it would be better with cheese but I assure you anyone would have loved my pizza. The only thing that sucks is they are mainly open for lunch so no nighttime pizza runs. Either way their pizza is delicious with very fresh ingredients and masterful pizza makers,italian

This is my favorite pizza place in the North Hills because of not only the taste but also the customer service from the owner and staff.  I can't tell you how many times I've been *that person* ordering 15 minutes before they close because of my work schedule and timing but every time they've made dinner, delivered it, and been exceptionally kind.  Most places would refuse the order - and I don't mean to be a jerk - but they always need commended and heavily tipped for their quality of product and service.  If you're wondering if this is the pizza shop for you, then yeah it is.  Give them a try.",italian

I'm not usually a big breadsticks person because I feel like I get enough bread with the pizza itself but these were so. good. The seasoning and parm cheese on these were to die for and the dipping marinara they provided was so thick and had the best flavor. 

The pizza was pretty good too but I have to admit, the breadsticks outshined it! I did like how the sausage pieces were large!

Called and placed an order and it was ready in 15 minutes! They have a parking lot and it is easy to go in and pick up your pizza. They also have some seating available so you can eat there if you prefer. Everyone there was so friendly and nice. Excellent customer service. We were going to use the Yelp check in offer ($3 off a large specialty pizza) but the guy actually told us they had a buy one get one 50% off deal which would save us more money, which was so nice of him! If you're looking for coupons they have a bunch on the back of their paper menus which are available on the counter.

For the pizza, we got a large cheese and a large Mediterranean. They were both delicious. We don't usually get plain cheese pizzas but our friend likes them the best so we decided to give it a try, and he was right, it was sooo good. They are very generous with the tomato sauce and cheese and it was perfectly melty. The Mediterranean is a good choice if you want chicken on your pizza. It also has spinach and peppers. It was very tasty and I would definitely recommend it. Two large pizzas were more than enough for five adults and a kid. We had more than half a pie left over.

The service was so, so. But the staff was very kind and friendly so it made up for it. The menu was extensive, items ranging from steak and crab cakes to sandwiches and chicken wings. We decided to order the grilled salmon, which was served with risotto and fresh veggies & the lobster ravioli which was to die for! Not to mention the appetizer (Ruben flatbread) which was out of this world good. 

Not only was the food delicious, but our drinks were as well! We both tried one of the $7 martinis (Wednesday night special) and they were both top notch! 

Saying this place was a great experience is an understatement. The food quality was untouchable, and the drinks were very unique. To top it off, the prices were very reasonable which is a rarity these days.

The salad: I typically love raspberry or cherry dressing but I feel like simple act of straining out the seeds would have gone a long way. I wasn't a big fan and that made it lose half a star. I also ordered a side of chips. I love homemade potato chips but these ones needed some salt badly. Half star loss on that as well. But my panini was one of the best steak sandwiches I've EVER had.

My husbands chicken Alfredo was good. The chicken had good flavor but several pieces had that over cooked rubbery texture.

Then the glasses for water arrived. One glass had a lemon seed stuck hard to the inside. Watched the waitress take a knife to it and have to scrape it out. The second class still had fresh lipstick on it. We were told it was just freshly washed but come on. It was unacceptable 100%

This time around, we ate in and decided to have the Diavolo pasta with the crispy chicken. Good flavor, although the ""crispy"" chicken doesn't hold onto it's crunch when it's coated in the sauce. They might be better served to just place it on top.

I met a group of friends for happy hour and we got there a little later than expected so it was just a few minutes before happy hour ended, but the ladies at the bar were still very nice and gave us our drinks and the food my friend ordered at the happy hour price which was appreciated.

Their happy hour prices are very reasonable, $5 drafts and half off apps. They had a good variety of beers on draft to choose from. My friend got the crab and artichoke dip and I didn't really like it, but everyone else enjoyed the flavor. I personally thought it was a little spicy and you couldn't taste crab.

It's a bit confusing to reach here.  You need to take a forever slow elevator to reach the rooftop.  Then when you get out you have to show your ID up top.  How about you have a person downstairs at the elevator entrance to bypass this.  That way you can make a swift entrance upstairs.

Getting up top, it's nice looking and huge.  But everyone seems to want to be up here.  Lots of people everywhere attempting to stake their claim at a table.  Makes for a hard time to move about.

Service, spotty at best.  For me I found that going to the bar myself to get my drink was faster than waiting for a server to get it to me.  I watched as my friends placed orders with their server.  While this happened, I went over to the bar and got my drink and returned to the table way before my friends' drinks arrived at the table.

What did I get
My friend brought me here for happy hour. I got the highball which was $5 for drinks like rum and coke. I also got their happy hour fries! Which turns out to be $2.50 a basket! The sauces that comes with it wasn't free! You need to pay for them, I wish she told me that though.... I like the seasoning that's in the fries. They were good

Environment
This is on a chain of 3 restaurants put together! This one is on the rooftop and when the weather is great they open it. It was good. The seating is open seating but you can always ask the servers for a table and they will make sure they secure a table for you!

Niceness of the staff
She was very nice to take our orders. I wish she told me that the sauces were extra. Not that I care but it would be great to know....

Its a great place during happy hour, get a couple of drinks with great views.

Parking: There is a parking garage attached and Osteria will valet your parking if you eat at the restaurant, which I think is a huge bonus.  

Upon entering the aroma smelled delicious.  Our table was already set up for us and we were greeting promptly and were served drinks immediately.  We shared a couple of appetizers - The Antipasta, Italian Sampler, and Bruschetta along with bread service.  All were great, I would recommend any of these starters.  

For my lunch entree I selected the Gnocchi.  It was delicious and the perfect sized serving.  I saw some of the other choices that my peers selected and they all looked amazing.  I didn't hear any complaints.  We were attending an event immediately afterwards and were short on time, but the staff knew and they were able to get us in and out of there in a great time.

The Pork Confit was my favorite- the truffle wine sauce really did it for me. The pork almost melted in my mouth. The Seafood Fra Diavolo was a tiny but spicy which I enjoyed but there wasn't anything too special.

I tried the prosciutto, margarita and cheese pizzas. The margarita was my fave. It was simple and delicious. The cheese made it, it was just crisp and delicious with a little bite. The prosciutto is from Parma Sausage. It's salty, so fair warning if you like or don't like salt. What I found unexpected, but enjoyed, was that the artichoke and mushrooms I choose to put on it were marinated in vinegar. It was really different but I loved it. I love pickled veggies, so this was a winner for me! You can choose from their own menu or make your own pizza.

I sat down and was met with cackling patrons staring at me and making fun of their neighbors and coworkers. My waiter was kind of loud and slightly frightened me.

I ordered the meatball appetizer and garlic bread. The garlic bread was good and garlicky and big. The meatballs were so-so and needed Italian seasoning.

My visit was me and a friend, dinner before theatre.  We sat down at 6 p.m. and told the waiter we had an 8 pm show. The service was very slow and at 7:30 we opted out of desert and had to leave. 

I had the porcetta and my companion had a chicken dish.  Both dishes were plentiful for the amount of food but both lacked any wow factor in taste.  The porcetta was sliced pork on a hard crusted bread served with roasted potatoes and broccolirob.  I was expecting flavor, but was disappointed.  It was just plain, plain, plain.  Same for the chicken.  

Given the fact that service was soo slow and the dished lacked any 'wow' I am giving it 3 stars.  The stars are for interior design, but shouldn't a restaurant want great food over pretty interior?

The stuffed pepper appetizer, we all agreed was one of the best we have had. I wish the gnocchis were a little more al dente but they were still good. Next time,  I would try the vodka sauce. My husband really liked his pizza but thought the crust could have been a little more crispy.  

Overall, this place was a great find and we all agreed we would come again. Our service was excellent as well.  Eric was the best waiter we have had in a while .  Just a tip, we ended up parking in a garage for $10 but later found out they do have valet for the same price.",italian

I went with a friend in the early afternoon for a late lunch and we were the only people dining as this place does close for a short recess from 3-5pm daily. I was really happy that the service staff continued to treat us kindly and didn't try and rush us in and out.

We ordered drinks and the Mussels & Clams to start out. I love the Drink, I can't remember the name of it but it's the cocktail with the vodka base, prosecco, and rosemary. It was light and refreshing. I will definitely order this again.

The mussels were given out in a large portion and I really liked the sauce. It wasn't what I was expecting but it wasn't bad at all. I liked how they gave out such a big dish. The sauce was a little too tomato-esque and I didn't like how it was watery, but I think the portion and the overall variety in the sauce: with the Acini De Pepe and the other vegetables were yummy!

I ordered the Pappardelle & Bolognese and my dining companion ordered the 4 course meal option. For the cost of it, it was worth it, however it was a little odd that everything was served at one time. I would have rather received the desert after the first three courses were served.

Beautiful and classy decor, huge wine menu and vegetarian options were some of the best highlights. However, the BEST thing about this place was the.. *drumroll*... bread! The bread, homemade cheese and olive oil was stellar. So delicious, we asked for another plate of it! 

I ordered the margherita pizza and enjoyed it. They have a very delicious smoked cheese at this restaurant and basically any dish with it is delicious. I loved the crust of this pizza, very home style. The sauce was average- I'm not a huge fan of very sweet sauce. My grandma ordered spaghetti and meatballs, very delicious, but the first time was too al dente. We had to send it back for them to cook it longer and then it was perfect. Overall, good experience. Very cheesy. Nice atmosphere. Kind waitstaff. Would return.",italian

The bread was cold and a bit stale tasting (may just have been a result of the temperature), and it was unwieldy to eat during what was supposed to be a work lunch. Thankfully it turned out to be more casual. In fact, I had a bite of my colleague's pizza and sadly, that too was just okay.",italian

Right behind the pop up shop is the actual store front where you can walk in and find a greater selection of fresh sandwiches and such. Be aware that the kitchen closes at 3 though. 

There is also a quaint attached dining area where you can sit on picnic tables and eat their wonderful food. 

What I like best about the pepperoni roll is that it's really easy to share among a large group and everything is made fresh daily. I've also tried some of their multigrain breads and been happy with those as well. 

Pro tip: Bring cash or be sure to have a $5+ order as they don't do credit cards for less than that.",italian

If you come on the weekends, they normally have a hot pizza roll stations outside their shop on the sidewalk. 
The warm, chewy, doughy rolls are cut into four slices. The pepperoni inside it is not overwhelmingly salty but just the right amount of saltiness. The marinara sauce is what truly elevates this pizza roll above others. It's a sauce that tastes like it takes days to make given the depth of flavors.

We were here for restaurant week, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the restaurant week menu features the same dishes as the regular menu. Same size, just a few less options. 
For RW you get an appetizer, main and dessert for a set price. I think it was $35pp. The popular choices were Lobster pappardelle pasta for a starter and either the bone-out pork chop or shrimp fra Diablo for the main. I went with the pasta for both, which was only a minor mistake only because I couldn't finish it all. Both were generous servings. Honestly I could have stopped after the appetizer and left full, especially because we added the charcuterie board before ordering. 

The Lobster pasta was fantastic. I couldn't believe how much Lobster was in there! The pasta was phenomenal. Onto the main, the pasta was like a shell shape in a red sauce and the shrimp was plentiful. 

Dessert was a scoop of vanilla ice cream with peaches in a crepe. Very nice.

I dined here years ago and was excited to return. We had purchased last minute (ahem...Groupon) tickets for a show at the Byham and found a great reservation at Mezzo for before the show.

Pros:

The food was delicious! I ordered the Quattro Formaggi pizza topped with arugula, and it was absolutely fantastic. The cheese packed a smooth yet strong punch, and the crust was perfectly doughy and crispy. I was so disappointed to have to leave half of my pizza at the table since I didn't have time to drop it off at my car in the parking garage before the show.

Cons:

Five of us were crammed at a four person table. I was stuck at the end and felt like there was no room for my food on the table or for people to safely walk past the table without tripping on my chair. It definitely downgraded the experience.

Our server was polite and well-spoken but overall underwhelming. She did ask if we were headed to a show, which I think is very important for servers in the cultural district. However, we weren't checked on after receiving our food, and by the time she stopped by, we were all sitting with our credit cards out of our wallets ready to pay and get to our show. I became frustrated when she casually offered us dessert since we were definitely way too short on time by that point to receive and enjoy it.",italian

We stopped here with reservations before a show at the Benedum. It is a very quick and easy walk. It wasn't too busy on a Thursday evening but there was still a great atmosphere. We were greeted promptly by our waitress and provided with a run down of the specials. Being obsessed with pizza, we were already leaning that way; however, there was a special pizza that sounded AMAZING: peaches, ricotta, red onion, oil, andouille sausage, and rosemary. I obviously opted for this and my husband ordered the Parmesan & Peppers. Both were delicious but the special was outstanding. I hope they add it to the menu! The dough and crust were perfectly crunchy and flavorful. Also, the pizzas are really good size! We each ordered our own but were very full!

We ordered the chef's choice charcuterie which was thoroughly explained and presented, as well as the capicola pizza. I appreciated that their wine list was extensive and went with a crisp sauv blanc for the hot evening. Our service was underwhelming and you definitely should make a reservation.

It took some time for the bar attendants to get to us to serve us but it was nice to relax while waiting.  If you're a soda drinker, be aware they don't serve fountain sodas but old fashioned soda in the bottles so each one costs.

We sat at the bar, ordering some of the specialty cocktails which were made perfectly, and the bartenders were exceptionally nice, also very talented. Of the food we ordered, everything was very good, but a couple of things REALLY stood out. The Bianca pizza - house made fresh mozzarella, ricotta, garlic, parmigiano, and prosciutto! It had recently won some awards out in Vegas and they were much deserved - OUT OF THIS WORLD. We also had the pizza feature for the day - chicken and artichoke, very good. The pizza is certified VPN (Neapolitan style) and it is simple, with delicious fresh ingredients - highly recommend. We also ordered the crabcakes, which were fresh, and FILLED with lump crab - great job on those. 

One that really stood out for me was the Burrata insalata. The burrata was served with delicious tomatoes, fresh basil, and EVOO. The burrata itself, was melt-in-your-mouth good, and was one of my personal favorites. Simple, yet glorious. 

Some of the dishes were hand delivered by the GM, Michael, and he seemed passionate and very knowledgeable of the menu/ingredients.

There is no way you can tell me this is gnocchi when it is burnt, the shape is weird and the size is tripled that of a standard gnocchi piece. When the gnocchi came out, my entire table was confused as we didn't know what that dish was and called the waiter over to ask if we got the wrong dish.

It was around 6pm on a weekday but already full, so we put our name in with the hostess and walked around outside for awhile. We then sat at the bar and had a drink. After 30 minutes of waiting (and a few tables opening up), the bartender went out of her way to check with the hostess to get us seated. We were very impressed with this service and were seated outside on a lovely evening. 

The meal itself was delicious. Our waitress was knowledgable and able to provide suggestions to us. We started with the mozzarella stuffed meatballs and YUM! I could make a meal out of those meatballs and a glass of wine. For entrees, we tried the mafalde bolognese, linguine and clams, and one of the pasta specials for the day. Everything tasted great  and was quite filling - the portions can definitely feed you for more than one meal!

584,4.0,usFNFsaaHFxEbnBO4FaFHA,"Piccolo Forno has been on my list for years since it's always on the Best Restaurant list in PGH, but haven't had a chance to visit until recently (note: they don't take reservations, so have to mentally be prepared to wait). Definitely worth the wait! We visited on a Saturday evening after a Pitt football game...we arrived around 6PM and were seated without a wait, which was clutch.. The space is larger than expected, but I imagine it can get pretty full at peak times. Piccolo Forno is BYOB (small corkage fee), so definitely bring your favorite wine with you! BYOB is not super common in PGH, so definitely a perk of this spot. 

While this is very much so an Italian restaurant, their menu has a rustic yet modern feel to it - think slight twists to classic Italian dishes. So if you are looking for your run of the mill Italian restaurants, probably not your spot; if you want to be a little more adventurous (i.e. me every day), definitely a place for you. We were pretty starved, so we started off with the polpette toscane AKA their meatball appetizers. To the eye, I would have easily mistaken these for aranchini - the meatballs did not at all look like your traditional meatball. However, they were tasty, definitely a different flavor - the combo of beef and pork, the light breading, and the unique sauces (salsa verde, giardiniera, and romesco) made for a nice dish, but definitely not one of my favorites. Also good to note is that there is complimentary bread for the table - not something often done anymore! For mains, I got the tagliatelle con ragu di agnello (braised lamb with olives, a hint of orange, and spinach pasta), and my boyfriend opted for the lasagna - both options highly rated on Yelp! I loved my dish - I would never think to pair lemon with lamb and with olives, but the different flavor profiles really meshed well together. My BF also really enjoyed his dish - we had heard that the lasagna had nutmeg/cinnamon flavors with it, so we were very intrigued. Although unexpected, this spin, paired with the creamy beschamel sauce and beef ragu, made this a standout lasagna that you certainly can't find elsewhere. The portions were generous, so we did take part home - I was happy to enjoy another day! We have heard really great things about their pizzas, so definitely on the list for the next visit. We were too stuffed for dessert, but definitely want to try their tiramisu and gelato next time.

Overall, the wait for Piccolo Forno was well worth. We were very impressed with our lack of wait, and for the amount of food we received, definitely not too overly priced. While I'm all about putting unique spins of items, the meatballs were a little too in left field for me; but, all the other dishes were well done!

My wife and teen daughters are on a 5 day road trip and are in search for some of America's secret culinary treasures.  The second stop in our journey from Michigan found us at Sarafino's.  Based on several reviews we were optimistic that there would be something special in line for our family.  No disappointment as the menu and specials made our choices quite difficult.  Fortunately or unfortunately they were out of an ingredient necessary for the meatball sub so my wife and youngest daughter easily went with the veal.  My oldest found a pasta dish that had her initially excited, but when she heard that scallops on the specials list the idea of sharing an entree quickly became an idea that dad get the pasta and she get the seafood special.  As we had previously committed to sharing, a potential compromise was hatched and we requested that scallops be added to the pasta dish that included basil, sun dried tomatoes, feta, and pine nuts.  Our waitress quickly agreed that this would be a good addition and our food order was set.  I should mention that Sarafino's is a byo and although we were aware had made no plans to address this.  However, there is a wine cellar D&O a block away and while the girls mulled the menu I made a quick run for a bottle of red (see D&O review for a quick account of this perfect local option).  I was back before our starter of mussels arrived.  Although not my first choice (family changed the order plans during my wine run) there was no disappointment in the decision or the flavor.  the only thing that might have made it better could have been more bread to sop up the broth with (however more bread would have made the entrees less appealing because we all would have been too full to finish our amazing meal).  When our entrees arrived we were not disappointed and we enjoyed classic Italian the way it is meant to be enjoyed (sharing across the table and laughing as we discover a simple yet exceptional meal).  Sadly no dessert but when we were finished we were full and happy.  The staff at Sarafino's were great and reviews that indicated staff would rush to clear tables seemed to be inaccurate (we stayed quite a while enjoying the food and company) and we were easily one of the last groups to leave for the night.  
Thanks to Sarafino's for an outstanding Italian experience!  Also, with  D&O so close no disappointment in byo as a quick taste prior to purchasing a bottle is always the best option.",italian

The menu is a little small but that's how you know everything they put out is going to be amazing. They also have other specials not on the menu - my fiancé got a giant bowl seafood pasta with white clam sauce and ate the entire thing.  Even after a giant bowl of the beans and greens (which we also ate all of). 

Serafino's has the best of everything - great food, big portions, reasonably priced and BYOB. Definitely a local staple for a quality down home Italian meal",italian
590,4.0,kzbH1_l7VTSfFFcwTqY6vA,I came to Sarafino's on a Monday night with two of my girlfriends because we heard how good it was. It's a little gem located in Carnegie! We arrived around 6 PM and did not have a hard time getting a table.  About 30 minuets later the place was packed (even for a Monday night)!  From other yelp reviews I started off with the wedding soup! It was delicious and just as good as it looked! For dinner I got the crab cake special and shared a pasta dish! The crab cakes were wonderful and not too bready! The pasta was also fantastic! Italian food is my favorite and Sarafino's lived up to its hype! They are also BYOB with a $5 corking fee! Couldn't beat it and very reasonably priced! Highly recommend!!,italian

The lunch menu deals are fair, and the portion sizes are generous. My Italian sandwich was good, but I really wish I would have tried a pasta dish instead. 

My sister ordered a steak sandwich, and it was very tasty. The wedding soup was flavorful, and I would definitely order it again. I think if I were to go back any time soon I would get a pasta dish and a slice of lemon cake!!",italian
593,5.0,o6UJLrSQGZzUSsfCxVQryA,Awesome restaurant. We enjoyed it thoroughly. I had the veal marsala and my husband had peppers and sausage. Meals came with a side dish of pasta but I opted for the Garlic spinach.   There was an upcharge for it but it was worth it.  Breadsticks came with the meal. It is a family run business and they are very friendly. Prices tend to be a little high but our meal was excellent.,italian
594,4.0,o6UJLrSQGZzUSsfCxVQryA,"We were Mia Madre fans before they left for a different space and then returned to the same quaint location in Avalon. We're glad they are back serving up some super tasty Italian food.

For a starter, we tried the beans and greens which featured very lightly sautéed escarole with northern beans and garlic in olive oil.  The escarole was very firm so it added a unique texture to the dish.  The flavors were light and not heavy on the garlic. 

Our entrees included the Linguini with Clam Sauce and the Linguini with Marinara Sauce and Meatballs.  If you are torn deciding between those two dishes, I would highly recommend the Linguini with Clam Sauce.  It was truly outstanding with huge roasted garlic cloves and tender clams.  It was really fantastic!  The Marinara was very delicious too and the added meatballs were a terrific addition.  We also opted to add a side of Spinach with garlic and olive oil that was super delish!  

This place is BYOB - $8 corkage fee per bottle - and they ONLY take CASH, which is sort of old school.  Do people really use cash anymore?   It's nice that they have an ATM in their lobby and they could likely benefit from having other modern pay options available.",italian

598,5.0,Z6_gRH_m8FQlKgsNkZKmTg,"As I ride home in our uber after a splendid birthday dinner for my beautiful wife, I feel compelled to provide a glowing review of Lucca, specifically the service at table 32 by the charming and knowledgeable Peyton (please accept my apology if I spelled it wrong). Lucca was a last minute change and turned out to be quite the dining experience. Peyton masterfully guided us on a smooth tour of the food and wine menu. We started with perfect mixed dirty martinis and excellent appetizer recommendations of gastronimo and mussels. We elegantly danced on to a recommended bottle of cabernet to accompany our entrees, each of which were crafted with care and creativity. After dinner, Peyton waltzed us through a carefully selected dessert menu and dipped us oh so gently to the perfect desserts and drinks to pair. What started as a reservation on a whim turned into a glorious yacht cruise captained by Peyton. Highest recommendations for both the restaurant and for our server.",italian
599,3.0,Z6_gRH_m8FQlKgsNkZKmTg,"Came here for a group dinner event. We had the meatballs as an appetizer in addition to bruschetta. I enjoyed the meatballs but think they would have been better without the baguette and with larger meatballs. The bruschetta has artichoke in it which I was taken aback by and honestly didn't taste like bruschetta. I think traditional bruschetta would be preferable. I addition the baguette the bruschetta is used for did not taste fresh.  

The fettuccini came with smoked pork with Lavender-Chipotle Cream Sauce and Pickled Beets. It was an interesting twist but not sure if the combination worked. The pasta was a bit spicy so be aware then ordering (our waiter did inform us of this). 

Overall I think this place takes Italian food and puts a spin on it but I'm not sure if they are getting it quite right. I think for the price tag the food is average. I think there is great potential but there definitely needs some fine tuning in their recipes. I wouldn't come back here given the price tag on their food.",italian
600,2.0,Z6_gRH_m8FQlKgsNkZKmTg,"The food quality does not justify its price. The meatball appetizer was cold; the brussel sprouts were tasty but they had no hint of the advertised garlic truffle oil. The risotto was apparently made with regular white rice and was, therefore, not creamy at all. The filet add on was a bargain at $9; I'm so glad I added it or I would've paid $17 for tasteless rice. 
The server was friendly but I had to ask for a spoon and sugar for my coffee. Coffee should be served with a spoon.
All in all, my family was very disappointed. The bill was almost $300 for a party of 5 -- and that included $15 for a glass of house Chardonnay. We won't be back.",italian
601,1.0,Z6_gRH_m8FQlKgsNkZKmTg,"Don't waste your time if you want to enjoy a nice meal and wine. The service was terrible and the food was cold. We chose this restaurant because of their beautiful patio and that was the only positive thing about my experience. 

The waitress would barely take our drink orders. I had to ask her 3 TIMES to understand what each person wanted - it was only 4 of us! We soon ordered our meal and that's when the waiting started. We watched as table after table around us not only got their meals but finished their meals before we got anything. To add insult to injury the waitress never came to check on us. She would walk past us to serve the other tables. 

When the food finally showed up 1 hour and 20 minutes after we arrived, it was just as I expected it to be COLD. My pasta was lumped together and the other dishes were subpar. 

We complained to someone (I'm not sure if they were the manager) and though they provided a discount, it was clear they were not very sympathetic at all. 

My friends and I are newer to the area and enjoy a nice meal. Good food, wine, a nice atmosphere. We are ok when spending money on a great meal, but after leaving here I had to stop at McDonald's. I would give this place no stars if I could.",italian
602,3.0,Z6_gRH_m8FQlKgsNkZKmTg,Not bad. Came here with a group of people. The food was just ok. Nothing majorly delicious about this place.

From appetizers through desserts, everything  was superb. Fried zucchini, crispy sesame calamari, stuffed banana pepper were all excellent appetizers. My entree was veal piccata and was probably the best I've ever had. My husband's filet was melt in your mouth delicious! Pecan ball was best ever dessert. So many layers of flavors make this food sooo good. Excellent ingredients yielding excellent dishes. Kudos to the chef! One of the best in Pittsburgh for sure!

Oh, and the service was spot on and the decor was lovely. Definitely worth a 5 star review. Thanks for a memorable meal.",italian
604,3.0,-j0CbYvlwuJ3Tfx__X38gA,"This place is hyped up, usually by the older bougie type, so I thought I'd see what the fuss was about. This is your typical stodgy, Italian place (though I think the outdoor patio would be lovely in the summertime). We ordered the sesame calamari as an appetizer - this had so much potential, but the chef needs to have a much lighter hand with the salt levels and the glaze. It would have been amazing if the glaze had been drizzled over instead of what I can only assume was ladled on. For an entree, I got the chicken Romano with pasta side and upgraded to the special salad of burrata and arugula. My partner got the Alfredo pasta and chicken pastina soup. The burrata was not as creamy inside as I would have hoped though all the veggies were very fresh. The chicken romano was a little soggy and the pasta sauce was good but the texture of the pasta itself was off. The Alfredo sauce was way too salty. The soup was probably the best part of the meal, though it wasn't necessarily mind-blowing... Overall we left feeling like we wouldn't come back here - the food has potential, but just didn't end up coming together right in any dish. And the salad upgrade was $14 in addition to the cost of my entree which was a very unpleasant surprise. Service was top notch though... I'd come back for drinks on the patio in the summer.",italian
605,4.0,-j0CbYvlwuJ3Tfx__X38gA,"Outstanding food. Our monthly ""supper club"" went here and all in all, left very pleased. Appetizers included fried zucchini (6/10), stuffed banana peppers (6/10) and crab balls (7/10). Our entrees were mostly veal of some sort (all well received) and I opted for the homemade ravioli. They were near flawless and came with a meatball that was tender and packed with flavor. The cheesecake is definitely worth getting for dessert! The one downside to all of this, and I hate to say it because I really enjoyed the food... the atmosphere is very... ""stuffy"". White linens, very intimate seating. Our group of 6 laughed pretty loud a few times and could notice people turning and looking at us. Probably best suited for a 1 on 1 type dinner.",italian

Joseph Tambellini hit the ball out of the park! This was probably the best Italian food I've ever had and it gets 5 stars for the dessert alone. Every course is wonderful and I definitely recommend that you save room for dessert and take your leftover dinner home. We tried the crab balls, sesame calamari, spaghetti and meatballs, chicken parmesan, soup, and salad and everything was cooked wonderfully. For dessert we shared the butterscotch pound cake and it was warm, moist, and absolutely spectacular. We made another visit to this restaurant two weeks later before moving away and will definitely visit again the next time we're in Pittsburgh.",italian
607,1.0,-j0CbYvlwuJ3Tfx__X38gA,"Came here because of the reviews and I couldn't have been more let down. I truly only enjoyed my Pellegrino and my salad. The bread came with a dipping sauce that was truly sad. It had a confused flavor. The salad was truly delightful as was our very kind server. 
I ordered one of their ""most popular dishes."" It was literally a huge plate of boiled and very thick pasta with the smallest amount of olive oil and 0 flavor. 
I returned it because a toddler could have made better pasta. Not only did I not like it but my guest, who would eat almost anything couldn't stomach it either. I literally sent back the entire plate. I was extremely embarrassed because I have NEVER done that. I asked the server to switch it out for something different and was told the kitchen had ""thrown out the water, and it would take at least 20 minutes"". I don't exactly understand what that means. I told them not to worry and I could instead split the meal with my guest and we could get 2 desserts instead. Unbeknownst to me, the plate was packaged for me (even though I returned it) . After ordering two desserts and finishing our bottle of wine I requested the hill.  Upon receipt of my bill I was told, in a whisper by the server, I would have to pay for the rejected plate but it was packaged up for me so I was still allowed to take it home. 
I didn't want it fresh, why would I want to take it home?
Luckily it was only 27 dollars but the audacity of the manager was absolutely blood boiling. Especially since he didn't have the guts to address the issue himself and sent his poor young waitress to break the news to me. 
I have never had such poor managerial service. I absolutely did not expect it at what I perceived to be a respectable establishment from other yelp reviewers. The server is at no fault as she was very apologetic and provided excellent service. 
The manager or restaurant owner clearly need those 27 dollars more than I do which I gladly provided them as to not upset myself excessively on my birthday. 
What kind of a restaurant is this? Oh, and the kicker, they knew it was birthday, and still treated me like crap.
Even a fast food restaurant would have addressed the issue. 
The ravioli was the other dish we ordered and it brought back memories of chef Boyardee. It's insane how much it tastes like it. I would know since my niece and nephew gobble that up all the time. If you like chef boyardee you'll love the ravioli!",italian
608,4.0,-wXyBph4d0IQlQrS8H1rDw,"I've been to Senti a few times. It errs on the expensive side but time and time again the food proves to be worth the price. 

They serve complimentary bread with butter. I personally like the saltiness of the bread. 

I've had a few salads, though the menu has changed/morphed a few times since their opening. I particularly enjoyed the watermelon salad on their Nuovo menu; it has ricotta salata, pistachio, and a soy dressing and is soooooo tasty. 

I've ordered the cheese plate on a few visits as well. I've never received the same cheeses on consecutive visits and they are usually paired with accoutrements like jam, honey, and garlic. I like that you can have a new experience every visit. 

Some standout main dishes are the gnocchi and the lasagna. I am a huge proponent of bechamel on lasagna and they've nailed it. 

Their bartender is always mixing up new drinks along with some classics. If you're into cocktails, definitely give the specials a try.",italian

Highly recommend for drinks and apps. The appetizers were tasty, but sparsely served.  The salad course was very good, but the main entree (I had lasagna) was just okay. There was nothing wrong with it, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. The consensus at my table on the other entrees was the same- fine but nothing great. Service between courses was very slow, which made for a very long evening in the middle of the week. I'm not sure that I would go out of my way to go here again.",italian

We started off with a simple salad. The dressing was super simple but made the salad! For the main course, I had the salmon with broccolini. For dessert, I had the apple pie with vanilla ice cream. The vanilla ice cream was superb. Overall, their food is very simple, but executed very well.",italian

I came with a group of six and got seated right away. They are very helpful when it comes to selecting wine, and I ended up getting two glasses of their red blend because it was so good. 

Lucky for me I always go to restaurants with friends and family that want to share everything so I was able to try a lot of the menu!! The soup of the day was a great choice but not as tasty as I wanted it to be; it was a tomato truffle soup. We also ordered the short rib, which was amazing, and the beet salad. All of the options are fairly small so I highly recommend ordering a bunch of plates and sharing them all. 

I split the salmon dish and the fettuccine carbonara with my sister. Both were soooo tasty and amazing. The salmon was cooked perfectly, and the noodles in the fettuccine were clearly made in-house and so delicious. 

Our servers were also super friendly and attentive. We parked on the street, which I'm assuming is usually packed since Lawrenceville is becoming a hot spot in Pittsburgh, so plan accordingly when making dinner plans at Senti!",italian

The atmosphere was warm, cozy and very friendly; and the food was fantastic. I had the Puttanesca and it was simply ""fantastic"", very freshly prepared and so very favorable . . my wife had the seasonable Butternut Ravioli, which was melt in your mouth good. The wine selection while not overly large, was filled with great choices and priced just right.

After such a great meal, we just had to have dessert and chose both the homemade ice cream and tiramisu to share . . both were very good!

I started with their new england clam chowder.  It is safe to say that you kind of know what to expect when ordering certain dishes but not this time.  The broth was not very think but tasty,  There were small shrimp and bay scallops but I didn't notice any clams.  There were no chunks of potatoes but carrots.  They garnished the chowder with ample amounts of scallions.  I take it that they have their own spin on new england clam chowder but they should have said that it is not traditional chowder.  It is not that it didn't taste good, it is just that it was not traditional clam chowder (which was what I was expecting when I ordered it for $10).

I also ordered a sausage pizza that looked better than it tasted.  The crust was stiff without much flavor.  I am a little bit of a pizza snob so the pizza did not do the trick for me.  

The provided very good bread on the table with olive oil and a clove of roasted garlic.  It is hard to find good bread so I appreciated it.

All in all, I may go back again to try other items on the menu.  Hopefully my next experience will be better.",italian

Our waitress was terrible, one member of our party tried to order a Cabernet and was told they were out, no big deal. She changed her mind to a Sauvignon Blanc.  Our waitress brought a glass of red, we were told it was the rarely heard of Cabernet Sauvignon Blanc varietal. We tried to tell her there was no such thing, but she responded by telling us to ""enjoy what we had ordered"" and walked away  Dinner took 3 hours and we waited 40 mins in between our salad and entrees. The food came out cold, the pasta was gummy, the chicken was dry as was the swordfish. The risotto was congealed. Our waitress finally checked in on us and asked how everything was and said she would ""get us Togo boxes so we could enjoy what we hadn't quite been able to finish."" All 4 of us had only eaten 2-3 bites. The owner/chef came out and immediately took an attitude, ""I'm sorry that my cooking isn't up to your incredibly high standards"" was how he opened. 
We explained what had happened, and he tried to walk back what he had said, but truly the damage had been done. 
Absolutely a terrible experience.... will never return.",italian
616,4.0,rUy2MtHyFv8pI7FOW1DE8w,"The last few times I have been to Pino's it has been a little disappointing.  On each occasion there has been at least one or two things on their menu that they were apparently out of.  With an already limited menu, this was frustrating.  The last two times it was the cheese plate.  This was a real bummer, as my wife and I loved their cheese plate the first time we came here.  The last time they were also not making their pizzas which makes up almost a quarter of the menu.  

On my last trip here I ordered the surf and turf off of the Valentine's Day menu.  For the price, the dish was very underwhelming.  For what they were charging I was expecting a high quality, properly cooked piece of meat and a lot of juicy crab stuffed lobster tail.  Instead, my plate just looked empty and sad.  The meat was overcooked and the lobster tail only had about 5 bites I could take before it was gone.

Still a great place, but I hope they get back to being extraordinary like the first time I came here.",italian

The ambience is cute. A smaller restaurant with some cozy tables but not loud. In the summer there is also patio seating.

The servers we have all had have been polite and friendly and willing to make recommendations if asked. No issues with timeliness of food or drink! Everything came out as expected. 

We were particularly blown away by the cheese board. We could have ordered two of those for our meal! The cheeses were delicious and paired so well with nuts and fruits and honey. The wines were also very delicious.",italian

This restaurant has a particularly legendary status, and is frequently credited as a precursor to Pittsburgh's vibrant dining scene. Well, the reputation proved true. The cocktail list was so creative that I couldn't resist trying one - I opted for the Sparkling 128 and it was a perfect fall concoction. 

It was very difficult to decide on an entree, but between the bartender and the nice regular who sat next to me at the bar, they helped me work through the options. I settled on the spaghetti ai frutti di mare, switching out the spaghetti for rigatoni. The rigatoni was the most perfect al dente texture and the flavor was perfect. While I fully intend on working my way thru the menu, it's going to be difficult to move from this dish. Wow. I paired it with an excellent Greek white from an excellently curated wine list. In lieu of desert, I had a glass of Chianti. Equally wonderful.

This is easily the best Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh. Without question. I cannot wait for my next dining experience here. And if you go alone, the patrons are as wonderful as the food. You'll easily make a friend.",italian

When you first walk in it's the bar with seating and some tables along the windows. The ambience is great low lighting and Intimate.  We were seated in the dining area the ambience was the same through out the restaurant. Everything was very tight you are seated closer than a arms length away from the next table. 

Upon ordering we wanted to try a few drinks, Appetizers then order our meals but our waitress insisted that we order all together because the chef doesn't like tables to order as they go. I hesitated because I have been in other restaurants and this is usually how they rush you. I did state to the waitress that we made a reservation and intend not to be rushed and wanted to enjoy the night. 
The food was delicious but I felt rushed and I hate feeling that way!

Everything we had was delicious. We had the eggplant and mozzarella appetizer, rigatoni, Sage and butter risotto, and the peach tart for dessert. We also shared a bottle of wine that was also very good and reasonably priced ($33 for the bottle). The rigatoni was the perfect blend of flavors- cheese, peas, and pistachio.

We had someone with food allergies at our table and she was able to pinpoint everything on the menu that she could eat. What I was most surprised about was how quickly the food came out. It only took about 15 minutes to come out since we ordered! And wow was it amazing! I had the rigatoni and I couldn't even finish it because it filled me up right away. Literally amazing.

I enjoyed the Paccheri but would probably order a different dish next time. They have another restaurant (The Twisted Frenchman) on the second floor that I'm interested in trying as well.

629,3.0,Egwnk84ioGxzx6BsJmWkrw,"East Liberty is brimming w restaurants, many new and many I have not tried. This was special occasion and looking for a different venue we went to Garbarinos. First off the entry is poorly designed. It wasn't designed. There was no thought concept idea awareness prior past experience knowledge of what happens when entering a restaurant be it IHOP or Au Pied de Chochon. There needs to be a host station where someone can greet guests. It needs to be somewhere visible. There needs to be a place where people can gather while this is going happening. Not outside of the restaurant in the vestibule immediately at the bottom of the stairs shared w the restaurant on the second floor. And no one working inside can see that there are four, six, eight people sheepishly waiting there at the unstaffed podium unless they walk out there to check. Huh. I have been in many busy successful places where the host station is crammed and jammed and annoying. I have been in many where you wonder if someone really works there. But this is the first one where I wondered is this possibly the place. After some time some one from the arriving party would come in, go up to the bar just inside and ask to be seated. That's what we did. Either someone showed up to help or the bar staff would make a call. Ok I've beaten thIs. 

The interior is big and open and attractive. This part was designed. Everyone once seated seemed content and enjoying themselves. 

The menu is good and the food was ok. A competent packaged Little Italy experience. Could support a bit more zest and depth as far as taste. Portions are very generous and it seems the take-a-way is part of the schtick.

The staff were also good and helpful. Not necessarily in sync but certainly striving to make things work even if no one seemed to be actually in charge and running the place. 

It's new give it time.",italian
630,4.0,Egwnk84ioGxzx6BsJmWkrw,"Again I wish I could give half stars as this restaurant would get 3.5.  We went to celebrate and ordered a lot of food to share.

First off, happy hour is not worth it.  The happy hour cocktails are ok, and the HH apps are just a few dollars cheaper than menu price.  We decided to order the more enticing apps of the full menu then the hh menu.

The cocktails we had that were seasonal, were very tasty, whereas the HH cocktails tasted mostly of champagne (not a problem, but in comparison we were let down).

For our appetizers we got meatballs, fried artichoke hearts, and the Brussels sprouts.   The winner of the three was definitely the sprouts.  I have never had such tasty sprouts before.  Crispy with a touch of sweetness from honey - delish, we finished the huge plate and thought about ordering more.  The meatballs were light and yummy, though there are better meatballs in Pittsburgh, and the artichoke hearts were a bit basic.  Battered and deep fried with marinara sauce on the side - I would expect to see this more in a bar/pub setting and was a bit let down.

The four of us shared the following entrees: Chicken Parmesan, Eggplant Parmesan, the Gnocci, and the Bolognese.  The hands down winner (and the reason I gave it 4 stars over 3) was the gnocci.  It tasted of delicious roasted red pepper, and was (i think) lightly deep fried.  This gave the gnocci a slighlty crunchy texture on the outside, followed by the smooth, velvet cloud that you get from a stellar gnocci.  I would return for this dish.  The chicken parm and bolognese were good, but didn't stand out in the same way.  Standard, good, but not amazing.  The eggplant parm was also good, though as a fair warning, it is more like a casserole or lasagna than what most people expect with eggplant parm.

The venue is a bit big for the number of tables/space.  It didn't feel warm or homey and the ceilings are super high.  The bar is really cool to look at and the kitchen is behind windows which I tend to love (though it wasn't so busy on a Thursday night to take full advantage of)",italian
631,4.0,Egwnk84ioGxzx6BsJmWkrw,"We are going to Italy this week, so I was hungry for Italian. I had been meaning to try Garbarinos since dining at the Twisted Frenchman upstairs this summer.

Garbarinos has a casual vibe, but it's menu is anything but bar food. I would like to say that we tried several dishes, but they had posted a new risotto that day with roasted brussel sprouts and squash, and we were all too tempted by that to try anything else. We did have an aperol spritz before dinner, and would highly recommend it. The risotto did not disappoint, and was big enough that I took a third home with me for the next day's lunch.

For dessert we had limoncello gelato (me) and cannoli (the others).  My gelato was perfect, but the cannoli was a little disappointing to the others at my table.

I would give this three and one-half stars based on the service. Our server seemed to have an attitude that was off-putting, strolling over to our table with his hands in his pocket, cutting me off when I was asking a question, etc. I'm usually pretty forgiving in this regard, but his attitude detracted from the experience.",italian

I was here for a lunch with some work colleagues, covered by our boss (just because), and I think i'll suggest a better place next time that's still convenient for everyone. I'm not gonna exhaustively comment on everything, but I'm gonna hit a couple key points. 

1) whoever whipped up the cocktail sauce for the calamari just dumped a bunch of red pepper flakes right in the middle of it, so if you spooned out from the middle onto your small plate, you got all heat and no flavor. 

2) The ""Spicy Arrabiata"" Pizza is a complete dud.  It's not spicy at all, and oddly has one of the strongest cheeses, gorgonzola ""mixed in.""  Well, even that's being generous.  There's pockets of it amongst the other stuff and it overpowers any other flavor on the pizza, not that there is much.  Why's it (both the gorgonzola on the pizza & the not spicy pizza) there?

640,1.0,XxmziAeRqMKwsDjyyjVgeg,"Worst dining experience of my life. Too bad Yelp insists on one star.
This happened a couple of years ago and it still bugs me so much I decided to post this review. 

I was staying at the hotel across the street. It was getting a bit late and they recommended it. No problem. Love Italian food. 

I could accept that little kids were running around and 'helping out' and asking me if I wanted bread, water, where are you from etc because their family owned the place and mom was working in the kitchen. I was just one of two tables and by myself. Really tired, but that's fine.

I didn't complain that my order was wrong (I was just one of two tables..) because the server was so nice. No, the kids didn't take my dinner order, just the bread and water. I was too tired to wait for a new order so I ate it. It wasn't great, but service was taking a long time and it was fine so I just decided to eat it so I could get back to my hotel. They forget my wine. I said it didn't matter, didn't need it anyways. 
They offered me a free dessert for the trouble and I said thank you but not necessary. Apparently he felt bad because he went and got the owner. 

She came over and apologized and I said not to worry about it and pulled out my Visa. She looked at my card and then asked me if I was going to cheat her because my card was Canadian and did I have another card. Sorry, cheat her? It's a Visa, it works everywhere (don't you get visitors from other places?) and no it's my only card, sorry. I had Canadian cash which she didn't want. Ok I get that but it's a Visa. I had no worry about it's viability. I travel all the time and had just used it at the hotel. 

She leaves and marches back and said it didn't go through and gave me an aggressive lecture on trying to scam restaurant owners. What? Weird that she accused me then it all of a sudden didn't work. I called Visa and they said it was ok. Oh and (hence the edit on this) the waiter had mentioned that they had trouble with their machine earlier too. So she took all of my information and wrote it down and said if I was cheating her she'd make my life hell. Finger pointing in the face. Ok lady, it's ~$15+ t/t and my card is fine, you were having machine troubles and don't have an ATM. So I told her where I was staying, gave her my driver's license, said I'd go to the ATM at the hotel if it was bad but it wasn't. At this point I was really irritated but remained calm. 

I went across the street to my hotel and 30 minutes later the front desk calls me and I hear a lady SCREAMING bloody murder in the background demanding what room I was in so she could come and take care of me. Yelling, swearing. The front desk lady said she was pounding on the front desk. I got on the phone and she ripped me a new one, called me an *&^%!  thief and kept asking me what room I was in so she could come and ...who knows. Screaming.  

I call Visa again. Apparently their machine was unplugged when she tried the first time so it didn't go through. They checked the line and when she keyed it in manually she had written my card down wrong. 

I called back and told her she got a digit wrong. She said oh ok, tried it again when I was on the phone. It promptly went thorough and she hung up. I called her back and asked for an apology for swearing at me and basically threatening me. I didn't get one. She said she was completely within her right to react that way and somebody had cheated her last week and she would always protect her business then hung up on me. 

The. Worst. Ever. The lady was completely unhinged and the experience was terrible from start to finish except for the nice server.",italian

The homemade pasta reminds me of being back in my Nana's kitchen as a kid helping her feed dough through the machine and rolling it out. It tastes as good as the noodles she made if not better.

I think my entree was called Cavatelli con pollo do Judi. It was delicious. Judy was apparently there making the cavatelli canoes. I had the cannoli for dessert but was too full to really enjoy eating it. I shouldn't have had so much bread! It was delicious, though.

643,5.0,HjrwseYzjupnpMdV4SaPWg,"We hadn't heard of this place before my wife accidentally stumbled on it on Pinterest. So we gathered up our intrepid neighbor dining companions and set off to Lawrenceville to check it out. If you're not looking for it, it's really easy to miss or cruise right by. It's once was an old Pittsburgh row house but now serves as a restaurant. When you go inside the first thing you see is a bar-like counter and wine (not beer) taps on the wall. Hmmm. I'm thinking that this wine is going to be on par with box wine. (Boy was I wrong!). But more about this later.)

Our first challenge is figuring out the process and where to sit. This front area is quite small with only a few small tables. So undoubtedly noticing the bewildered looks on our faces the hostess/bartender asks rhetorically ""is this your first time here?"" 4 nods from is and she explains that you order at the counter and get a number to display and go find a table. 

So we all decide what we want and now it's time to try the wine, which we learn is homemade by the owner. (Uh-oh...!) I'm gripped with impending fear. But the server (who turns out to be the owner/winemakers daughter) offers us free tastings. OK, let's try it. But it will be really embarrassing if we have to spit this out in her presence. But one sip and my fear turned to joy!  We each agreed it was delicious.  So much so we bought 2 different bottles to enjoy with dinner. 

So now we make our way to the back to discover that there is a beautiful quaint outside seating area, so we pick our table and plant our number for our server to find us to bring our food. The wait is not long after we pour and taste our wine. Out first come the starters: meat and cheese plate and fried zucchini planks. Delicious.

Mains were chicken piccata, sausage & peppers (x2), and pomodoro.  We all crushed it. 

Having been to northern Italy I can tell you that the food, atmosphere and vibe here was a lot like that. The friendly and accommodating staff was too. 

I was really tempted to be dishonest and give this place 1 star so the secret would not get out and become ""discovered "" thus creating long waits. But I would really love to see it succeed. So please only tell true friends and keep it on the down low.",italian

The zucchini planks are a MUST friends - so thin, crisp and served with homemade sauce which is phenomenal! Their sauce is so good - not sweet at all, and such a great texture.

I ordered the bottle and my meal at the counter and they give you a number to take to a table to sit. I ended up ordering the pasta primavera with a meatball and my friend ordered the rigatoni with grandma's sauce and meatballs. Our food came out very quickly and the portions were huge! I didn't think I would finish the entire plate of pasta but I devoured it in no time. The spaghetti in my pasta primavera was like an angel hair and soaked up the flavor so well. My friend's rigatoni was also rich with flavor. Their meatballs are pretty large and tasty. We ended up ordering cannolis for dessert, which were good, but nothing extraordinary.

We got busy lives and forgot about it. We went  tonight after a two year hiatus, and I can't express enough how it pains me to give this negative review. First thing I noticed is that there was no smell. There was no wafting aroma of delicious italian food. The second thing I noticed was the lackluster wait staff and nanchalant service. Our waitress seemed clueless. The waitress for the table next to us seemed uninvolved. When our wings  came out they looked like something off a Cornish hen. They used to be plump split wings. The sauce and ranch dressing was still to die for but the wings.themselves should not have been served to anyone. We had high hopes for my my strip steak salad and my husband's chicken parmesan. What we got was a small piece of boiled grey meat on a wilted empty salad. This was not ny strip steak. This wasn't even sirloin .  He got a watery flavorless meat sauce poured over mushy angel hair pasta. The chicken parm itself was dry and flavorless. There was no aroma. There was no seasoning . It was horrible .  It should have all been sent back. I was going to have my 45th birthday there this year but thank goodness we tried it out again before committing. We will never go back. This food was not edible. I've had better meals from fast food. What a shame.",italian

A resourceful son-in-law noticed Silvioni's across the street, called, and we had a table within minutes, we had PERFECT service (thank you, Veronica), and wonderful food.  We had brought a cake which Montecello's allows, and Veronica was gracious about cutting and serving it for us.  We will definitely be back - our gain is Montecello's loss.
Full disclosure - we did not know our server - so when i say that our service was PERFECT, i really mean it.   Even with 4 kids at the table, she was very patient, she knew the menu well, got each and every order right, delivered the food hot, she was helpful but not intrusive.

My daughter gives Rocchio's 5 stars too for the chili and meatball sub she got.  If you're in the area, stop by and enjoy some delicious food made with love.  She even sells a lot of locally made foods to fill your pantry.  So glad we found this place on Yelp!!",italian

670,5.0,UWi2CNiSSHrgsKfiI6qQDw,"If you haven't tried Rocchio's yet, you must! The deli is situated right on the main drag of Dormont (near Dor-Stop) so parking in the weekends can be kind of tricky! All on street. 

The deli is a small space, no room for eating or hanging out but is a great spot for take out/buy fresh meats and cheeses. 

Along with other reviews I agree that the price of items is a little much, BUT... the quality of what you get makes it worth it. My 6"" sub (veggie) was about $7 but the toppings inside, were plentiful and super fresh. I would have loved the option to toast this sub, I think it would have made it even better (if that's possible)

Renee, one of the business owners was extremely kind and generous. She had a sample of her ricotta cake out and of course I bought one. Again, almost $4 for a slice but it was SO GOOD! Would recommend it to anyone. 

I will be back, no doubt about it!",italian
671,5.0,UWi2CNiSSHrgsKfiI6qQDw,"My partner brought home takeout from Rocchio's since I have been saying for the past 2 weeks that I want to try it.

He chatted with the employee a bit about what is most popular, and was recommended the Rocchio & a meatball sub. He said the employees were very friendly and helpful in describing the different menu items they offer.

The Rocchio is an Italian hoagie on steroids. The meats and cheese are top notch & the roasted red peppers, crunchy lettuce, and delicious oregano dressing made this hoagie a slam dunk; one of the best I've ever had. I love that it was wrapped in traditional butcher paper - a nice touch!

The meatball sub was outstanding. The homemade meatballs were a nice size and there were 3 on the (six inch-ish?) sub with a good amount of delicious marinara sauce. It was topped with melted mozzarella.

The bread they use tastes so fresh & is a great texture. Yum!

He also got 2 sides of pasta salad which were absolutely delicious and a perfect accompaniment to our subs. 

We will be back in a heartbeat!!!! Great addition to Dormont.",italian

Thankfully this deli has much more to offer! From the VERY helpful and kind employees to all of their home-made options this place is a recipe for a fantastic deli! I had their homemade meatball sub, some macaroni salad and chocolate gelato. Their meatball is fantastic! And the bread they pair it with is just a good! Their meatball is a family recipe which makes it that much better! Their macaroni salad reminds me of the dish I remember having in my childhood which means it was a really really good pasta salad! Their gelato was rich and creamy! I recommend their chocolate gelato as that is what I tried and it was fantastic!

COME HUNGRY AND WEAR YOUR DRESSIEST STRETCHY PANTS! 

Parking: valet, a pay lot within a block or two and I think street meter parking?

You're welcomed with fresh homemade bread, an AMAZING dipping oil, tapenade, and a walnut honey sweet butter.

The house salad was one of the best I've had. The vinaigrette was homemade and stole the show. 

All entrees come with cavatappi alla vodka but I had it in good authority that you could get PASTA COOKED IN A FRIGGEN CHEESE WHEEL! My life will never be the same. It was so creamy and nutty and just absolutely amazing.

I got the veal scapollini with the escalopes preparation which consisted of wild mushrooms and sautéed spinach. My husband got the seafood diavolo and the scallops were as big as my fist I swear! There were YUUUGE chunks of lobster meat as well. 

For dessert we got a comped dessert but of course got a cannoli to go.

Can not wait to go back!",italian
674,5.0,vNQkym5qZ-E-4AJ4IQ5JEg,"Every time I come here, I find myself more stuffed than after thanksgiving dinner, with no regrets. 

Every entree comes with salad and incredible vodka sauce pasta. After my salad, pasta, and steak, I was more than full. However, we couldn't resist the raspberry tiramisu (definitely a sharing sized dessert!). 

We also ordered the smoked provolone appetizer which is INCREDIBLE. Try it!",italian
675,5.0,vNQkym5qZ-E-4AJ4IQ5JEg,"Wow where to begin?! I've been to a lot of great restaurants in the city and Alla Famiglia is near or quite possibly at the top. I will say that it isn't in a great part of town and depending where you're coming from taking an Uber could be easiest. I valet parked for $7 and had no problem. The attendant was there when I pulled into the lot at the restaurant and had the car ready right when I left. 

We were seated to a table that already had the ""holy oil"" for dipping which was a house oil with banana peppers and other seasonings, a goat and cream cheese spread with walnuts and a cheese with chickpeas. All were delicious but don't fill yourself up on bread as hard as that may be.

Looking at the menu, Alla Familgia is one of the higher priced places but they certainly back up the prices in terms of quality, favor and portion sizes which is great. I shared the smoked provolone, meatball, and olive appetizers with my wife. In terms of portion sizes, those all could've been split for a party of 4. 

The smoked provolone was rich and flavorful. The cheese definitely  tasted liked it was cooked in a truffle oil which brought out a certain rich and smoky flavor to the provolone. The cheese comes which almost crispy arugula on top and is served in 2 halves which is great for 4 people. It was so good and so easy to eat too much of!

The giant meatball was highly recommended and I can see why! After seeing pictures and reading other peoples reviews I just had to get the giant meatball that I always get when going to Italian places like this. It's cooked and served in a giant bowl of delicious and homemade tasting marinara sauce. The meatball is juicy and melts in your mouth (I will be using that expression again shortly) and how could this get any better? It's served in an outer layer of shaved cheese and has a big meaty gob of mozzarella inside of the meatball! As if it couldn't get any better! 

The olives were delicious and great for sharing with a large party. They came with two pieces of bread which were in the house oil. You could tell they had been soaked and were dripping in flavor. The olives felt fresh and had an almost orange zest to them which was great and adding a good twist with the garlic. 

For dinner I split the cotoletta del monzu veal with my wife. Let's just say splitting was still more than enough food because it was three pieces of meat and before I get to that it was served with a family style house salad and we each got a full pasta meal with it before the veal was even served! The house salad was awesome it had a delicious red wine vinaigrette and had olives, roasted red peppers, candies walnuts, raisins and Gorgonzola cheese on the side. I would buy that dressing and eat it for lunch every day it was so good. 

The cavatappi pasta served with the meals comes with the famous house vodka sauce. I loved vodka sauce but opted out to upgrade my pasta. My wife however, had the vodka sauce and I had some of hers. Oh my does that vodka sauce work. You can again taste the homemade quality. Full of flavor, it optimizes what a good vodka sauce should be with the fresh basil, herbs, and blend of creaminess and tomato. I went with the linguine which was served in a giant wheel of locatelli cheese. The pasta was added hot to the cheese wheel along with cream, pepper, and well lots and lots of cheese. I highly recommend the Chianti with this as the wine really picks up the locatelli and the pepper and Chianti is served as one of the by the glass wines. 

The veal was served with pine nuts, crab, and mozzarella with a lemon butter sauce. Did I mention melt in your mouth before? Well this veal does the same. The pine it is a bold and perfectly butter taste which is quite nice with the lump piece of crab of each cut of the veal. The veal is nicely breaded and is the perfect cut. I would recommend squeezing the lemon served with the meal across the plate to pick up a lot of the flavors. There are three cuts which is great with sharing because with appetizers and the salad and pasta combo beforehand, that will be a hard meal to finish and you need to make sure you save room for...

Dessert and oh man you gotta order something. We went for my birthday so we were treated to a nice little chocolate mousse cupcake of sorts with a raspberry jam on the side. That was yummy but we had been sitting in the gelato room where they made the delicious smelling waffle cones and after smelling them all night we were going to order something when the waitress mentioned that the raspberry tiramisu was the famous item. We went with that and oh man if you go here and don't order that, you're doing it wrong. The tiramisu is so light, so soft and most, it's like a tres leches meets tiramisu but with a raspberry profile. Sprinkled with burnt almonds on top, the tiramisu is the ultimate end to the apex of Pittsburgh dining",italian
676,3.0,vNQkym5qZ-E-4AJ4IQ5JEg,"We made a reservation several weeks ago in September for our anniversary and were seated on the outside patio.  I'm not sure but, in retrospect, I wonder if the patio doesn't get the same level of service as the interior.  The service was pretty abysmal even though several staff were buzzing around the patio periodically.  It took 20 minutes to get our bottle of wine and another 20 to get the bread with oils.  I don't know about you, but I really enjoy bread and wine together over a leisurely special meal.  There are only four or five tables on the patio so maybe it gets forgotten in the rush to serve the inside tables.  

We ordered the veal scaloppini with two different preparations - I had the Cotoletta Del Monzu with lump crab and T had the Margherita.  Both were super thin cuts (I know scaloppini is supposed to be thin but this was pounded very thin and had very little veal flavor).  

The plating was pretty and there were some nice big chunks of crab on the veal but the veal itself was a definite letdown.  They were nice enough to give us a dessert plate with Happy Anniversary written in sauce which was nice.  But really, for a $200+ meal for two, you have to do better with service and food quality.  The expectation level is raised at this price point.  

The valet parking situation is sort of disjointed, I must say.  We weren't quite sure if the person offering valet (after we waited for 10 minutes in a busy beer distributor parking lot) worked there or was a patron of the beer distributor. When we were leaving, we had to seek the valet out as he was not anywhere around the doorway or parking area. This was unexpected for such a high end dining venue. 

Hoping this was just an off night for them because we need great Italian restaurants in the city.",italian

My onllyyy thing I'd have to say as a women in heels, steps aren't always our friend lol. BUT the steps are very large and easy to maneuver with heels on. We sat on the original side where the original bar is. 

Our server was fantastic. He was so knowledgeable and quiteee the salesman but not in a cheesy or annoying upselling way. he simply said the facts and let the food speak for its self. We had smoked provolone with truffle and truffle oil. It was AMAZING. I didn't get to take a pic because the waiter actually cut it and served it to each of us. The portions of the food were intense.

678,5.0,QeShrs6cUNBjJoTCkJiB0g,"I took my parents here who don't get to Pittsburgh often so after hearing rave reviews from co-workers, I thought it was the perfect spot to show them how great of a food town Pittsburgh really is.

I was really impressed with Legends! They have some solid Italian food and it was the perfect place to take out-of-towners. My dad and I got the Chicken Parmigiana, my mom the Veal Parmigiana, and my boyfriend the penne vodka. We were all very impressed with the pasta itself - I'm thinking it was freshly made rather than dried. The chicken itself had a lovely breading and I loved how they didn't put sauce on the chicken - only cheese. It prevented the breading from getting too wet and they gave you plenty of sauce on the pasta to dip it in. The salads at the beginning were actually delicious and I'm not usually one to brag about a starter salad. The blue cheese that came in it put it over the top. They also gave us homemade breadsticks which were good but I could've easily eaten the whole basket on my own. The amount they gave probably equaled two regular sized breadsticks which was to be shared with 4 people. At the end of dinner, they asked if we wanted dessert and while that was tempting (the desserts coming out around us looked AMAZING), we had to pass. They did bring over some complimentary fudge though which was a lovely touch. 

I'll definitely recommend this spot to my friends and would be happy to return.",italian

680,4.0,QeShrs6cUNBjJoTCkJiB0g,"Very solid and respectable 4 stars for Legends (for a place to be 5 stars it has to blow my mind, and while Legends didn't, it was really good; i'd 100% return).  We had company visiting for the weekend and I love Italian food.  Friends too had recommended Legends to us, so we went there. 

Pro Tips: 1) Call to make a reservation if you're going on Friday or Saturday night.  They are quaint and very busy and you need to call the day before if you wanna go either of those nights. 2) Expect when you make that reservation to be asked something like ""is 90 minutes enough for you guys?"" Legends runs their place like clockwork, super-efficiently, so this is not the kind of place to sit down and mosey through your meal.  There needs to be a little efficiency on your end too. 3) Also this place is BYOB (or wine). 

We had a 6:45 reservation for a party of 3 and after waiting a few minutes for our table, one of the wait-staff said ""So, it's just going to be about 10 minutes or so.  There's been a slight mix-up but we're on it"" and she apologized.  Our wait ended up being about 30 minutes, but only because the people who were at the table they needed for us didn't leave!  They kept chatting over wine and dessert. If you're gonna do that over dinner, maybe not come to a quaint little place that runs like clockwork and needs to turn over the tables quickly.

But I digress.  As our wait dragged on, all the staff at Legends was super nice and incredibly apologetic, asking if we needed anything and providing us updates far more often than i'd expect.  They even gave us their Bruschetta flatbread special ""on the house"" because they were so sorry about our wait being as long as it got.  And that's a good intro to the food, because HOLY CRAP was that bruschetta flatbread amazing. Warm, soft focaccia drizzled with a very tasty balsamic over fresh cherry tomatoes with feta and super tasty italian sausage.  It was a flavor party I wish i could relive!

When we finally got our table (I may have shot a look at the patrons who had been pre-occupying it when they left as they clearly had had too much wine and had lost track of time (they'd stayed 20 minutes past being asked to leave since Legends needed the table)) we immediately ordered, having had ample time to peruse the menu. 

We were then brought our fresh toasted focaccia bread. This is where my first nitpick comes in. We were seated at the ""bar"" while waiting and I noticed one of the line cooks cut the bread, before putting it in the oven to toast, without gloves on! Umm, what?! Was he assuming the heat would burn off any germs on his hands that got on the bread? It was off-putting.

I got the Fettucine Alfredo (with chicken), my partner got the Spinach Ravioli and my mom got the Penne Vodka.  You get a small cup of soup or salad with your main course.  I got the soup (Italian Wedding) and the ladies got salads.  The salads were nice and my soup, while tasting like it'd be put on ""keep warm"" in the kitchen, was still very tasty and fresh like it'd be made earlier today. 

Our pastas were good, the tomato sauce on the spinach ravioli and the Penne Vodka is excellent.  My fettucine was great too, but honestly, it was missing that final touch to seal it as ""yup, i'd 100% get that again"", which I honestly think just comes from there not being any pepper.  Maybe put some in the sauce or have it at each table just in case?

All that aside though, everyone at Legends was great and we all really enjoyed our meal.",italian

The juice had no flavor as well so getting it dipped did not help anything but the staleness. The beef was a shredded pot roast instead of thinly sliced beef. The hot peppers were too big and not very spicy; they also had the wrong taste. Do not go to this place for a beef sandwich if you are expecting Chicago style beef. Any restaurant in Chicago with a beef on their menu blows this sandwich out of the water. Maybe their other sandwiches are good but if that's the case I recommend a name change.,italian

I mean most people don't know this but the owner of Benihana's son is Steve Aioki so if you have a long drive there, throw some of that stuff on. Turn it up all the way and tell your kid keep the iPad in the car, it's time to hang with the family and stop actin like a humanoid. Benihana ain't got time for that. 

Anyways every time I go there I get the hibachi spicy chicken with the spicy rice. Remind me of Shaq and Kobe. Fire. Recommend to everyone with tastebuds and a pure soul.",japanese
704,2.0,DPT4j7kxjLt332YMwFLkww,"I just want to update that my opinion on Benihana has definitely gone down after my visit last night for my birthday. It has changed a lot over the years and I think after this visit - I won't be back despite going at least 1-2 times a year.

The only thing great about my visit was the chef (Tommy) was really cool and the meat/seafood cooked well. The greeter at the front desk seemed miserable and not really friendly as you are walking in, the server at our table didn't seem like a people person - both her and the woman cleaning up our area barely acknowledged my guest and I but did with the other young chicks at our table. Were we invisible? I don't know but it was annoying. They usually give you a complimentary photo for your birthday with your guest - we seen them go to other tables doing this but never came to ours as they have done in the past.

One of my biggest complaints is the new up charge of $4 for fried rice. No other hibachi place does this (the meal is already high and more than pays for the fried rice vs white). Benihana never had this upcharge before - not sure if it changed this year but last fall it wasn't the case. The quality of food and friendly service at Benihana is what I liked over the years coming here however similar hibachi restaurants will now be my go-to as the service is not what it used to be here and it is more expensive compared to those other establishments as well - Saga, Ichiban, etc. 

There is no benefit to go to Benihana rather than the others now. The other places also do more tricks and have more of a show than the chefs here - the most they do here is throw utensils in the air and light the onions. Saga/Ichiban makes a train out of food, flickers the lights, shoots sake in your mouth, tell jokes, etc. 

My tip is to go to any other hibachi but here - where prior years I would prefer it here. They have poor service now, the cleaning staff really had no professionalism, and they have gotten greedy about fried rice. You are already paying $49 for your meal, come on right? How much is the eggs and veggies really costing them? Not cool.",japanese

The prices have gone up significantly, the service by the staff is very slowly and the restaraunt seems to be not very clean.  I've been here twice this past summer and both times our grills were not cleaned until it was time for a meal to be cooked. Very unappetizing to look at while you are looking at a menu.  I was also recently seated near the kitchen were 2 of the tables were used for staff breaks or like their lunchroom.  Those tables were covered in coats and purses and ""stuff"". Really unappealing.

If that's not your jam you can get a regular table and order from the menu.
They do fish, chicken, beef and etc. This is a Japanese restaurant so.. if you have an MGS issue the soup has it everything else does not but make sure you ask ok. The food is pretty standard fare, tastes good but could be hotter. Most of us got the lunch specials which came with a protein, vegetables and rice. With lunch you can have the soup or salad. I also ordered the beef dumplings but we had to send them back as they were cold. In all honesty they only had two groups doing Habachi at the tables and us? It was whatever.. our server was good but seemed a little busy considering. Due to my dumpling issue I got hot ones and she took it off the bill. The food was pretty good.. but not memorable. This place is not exactly easy to get to and or find as it shares a parking lot/space with a condo building. Will I be back here probably not or any other Benihana. They have parking..",japanese

708,4.0,CLSRz9E-HmQRDwV2_smoDA,"I came to this spot once about 10 years ago and had an OK meal, but I was seriously craving some Japanese food and decided to come back while taking my mom on some errands. The sushi itself was average at best. They seemed to have some sushi combinations I've not seen often and I was happy to try them, but there didn't seem to be a lot of flavor. 
Where they're earning the stars from me is on in regards to how well they cooked my steak and scallops. The steak was medium rare, tender, and flavorful. The scallops were seared quickly on both sides and nice and tender. The server also did a great job at keeping my tea filled and I never had an empty glass.
I think the biggest issue with hibachi is that while this meal was very good, you never know who you're going to get cooking your food. We sat in a booth, so I didn't get to meet the chef which means I don't even know who to ask for. I'm pretty sure I will try this spot again and I'm hoping I can add another comment that they did a great job of cooking the meats.",japanese

All of the meats that they serve with the hibachi appeared to be of very high quality - the noodles could be a bit more flavorful but the fried rice is good and I also like the vegetables - the broccoli, mushrooms and carrots - that come with it as well.

713,4.0,hDD6-yk1yuuRIvfdtHsISg,"Large selection of premium sushi and sashimi.

This time around I tried the Philadelphia roll and Spicy Tuna roll. Both are some of the cheaper options on their menu, but you get 8 medium-sized pieces in these rolls, so it's a decent value. The tuna roll wasn't spicy at all. Like, I could taste a little spiciness if I focused, but it definitely wasn't what I expected. Similarly, I couldn't taste the smoked salmon very much in the Philadelphia roll.

The spicy chicken appetizer, however, was appropriately spicy. It's also a cheaper option (being an appetizer) and it's half off for happy hour, which makes it a fantastic value. I would definitely get the chicken again.

I also got to try some of the more expensive sashimi that my friends ordered, and they are definitely worth the price. They were noticeably bigger than the budget rolls I ordered and came with good sauces and a big chunk of fish on top.

Overall, this restaurant is actually a pretty good value for a fancier sushi spot. They have a dress code which isn't terribly strict, but definitely helps set some expectations. And their food is certainly higher quality. But their prices aren't outrageous.",japanese

Situated in a strip mall just outside the Mall at Robinson, Sushi Bomb is a large, open space with plenty of seating for groups of all sizes.  The hostess greeted my friend and I with a smile as soon as we walked in the door and our waitress was quick to take our drink orders while we perused the menu. 

The concept is as follows:  all you can eat appetizers, sushi rolls, hibachi and noodle entrees for one price. You pick what you want from the menu and they make it fresh just for you!  The only thing on the menu that isn't included in the flat rate is the sashimi.

They do caution that you will be charged if you order more than you can eat, so it may help to start with a couple of rolls and then see how you're feeling before you order more.  I will say that I left two pieces on my plate and wasn't charged, so if I had to guess - they're looking more for people being wasteful with large quantities left unfinished.

We started with the Kani salad which was delicious, and a decent enough portion that I wasn't worried about not being able to finish the rolls I ordered.  Our sushi arrived shortly after the salad and I was pleased with the size and quality of the rolls.  My Tiger Roll and California Roll were presented nicely; the fish, rice, and ingredients were all fresh and flavorful.  My only regret is that I wasn't hungrier because there were so many more rolls I wanted to try!

Every specialty roll we've tried is great and they also do a great job with the traditional rolls if you are looking to keep it simple.

We started off with salad and soup.  The salad was one of the better ones I have had at a hibachi place.  Specifically, the dressing really stood out and had a great flavor.  The soup was pretty average.

For my meal I went with filet and scallops.  They give you both rice and noodles as sides which I thought would be great.  The rice was really good and I could have eaten a lot more.  The noodles however were doused in teriyaki sauce which made them overly slimy and not appetizing.  The overuse of teriyaki sauce was a theme throughout the rest of the food being cooked.  Almost everything, including the meats were slathered in a thick teriyaki sauce.  This caused everything to taste the same and created a pretty gross texture of the food.  My scallops were decent.  My steak was pretty good, however it was over cooked for medium rare.

I ended up ordering some sushi (spicy shrimp avocado roll) and hibachi chicken. I really like how for only 6 bucks, you get 6 pieces of sushi. At some restaurants I've been to in the past, 6 dollars worth of sushi means only 2 pieces! Also, hibachi gets you a lot of food for a pretty good price. The hibachi chicken came with salad, soup, noodles, fried rice, vegetables, shrimp, and the chicken. They also offer yum yum sauce to pour on your meal (the sauce is addicting and delicious). 

The food did take a little long to come out but was worth it. The chicken was very flavorful and not too salty. The texture of the noodles was perfect, and the veggies/salad were very fresh. The sushi was good too. 

I would highly recommend Saga for lunch or dinner- the food is great! Now I want to eat hibachi more often thanks to them!",japanese
749,4.0,HI6af2H4gZyXszxfYsuloQ,"What can I say...not the ""best sushi I've ever had in my life"" but it certainly feeds the craving, especially on Monday when 1. They have a special and 2. Other sushi spots are closed. My husband likes the hibachi because you get both rice and noodles. The service is okay -one waitress for the entire dining area in a Monday when they are busy seems stressful for that person and has left us without things we've asked for on occasion. Overall it's a good spot when it's what you're craving and convenient to the Robinson area.",japanese
750,3.0,HI6af2H4gZyXszxfYsuloQ,"The food is pretty good here but it's very inconsistent. You can order the same dish every visit and it will never be the same, from the size of the shrimp to the sushi. Although it's inconsistent it's usually pretty good. You can't beat the half price sushi on Monday nights. We prefer the dining room over the hibachi tables. The service is usually ok.",japanese

752,4.0,HI6af2H4gZyXszxfYsuloQ,"For my money, Saga is probably the best Hibachi and Sushi in the Robinson area. I find it far superior to Ichiban. 

In the end, all of these hibachi places are the same menu and experience, so I base this solely on the fact that Saga includes noodles with their hibachi selections, and I find their sushi to just be a better taste and quality than Ichiban offers.

At Saga you will get the complimentary squirts of sake into your mouth, they will springboard vegetables into the air for you to try to catch in your mouth and of course, the onion volcano. Some chefs are more energetic than others, but I think that can be found at any hibachi place.

I've been to Saga many times and it's always a good meal and a decent hibachi experience. I actually really love to go just for Sushi and sit at the Sushi Bar. The Sushi chefs usually will make a little something extra for you to try and it is always good.

If you are in the Robinson area and in the mood for hibachi or some Sushi, go to Saga.",japanese

Their sashimi and sushi are very fresh and the combination dinners are worth the price.

The staff was very attentive and respectful and service was great. The food was prepared incredible fast, there was hardly a wait for anything. It was surprising to see this restaurant so packed on a weekday night but obviously it's because it's a place people want to come back to often.",japanese

Tempura Shrimp: This app was a great way to start off the meal.  It came with 15 or more shrimp in a mayo based sauce.  The shrimp were fresh but I wish the sauce had a bit more spice. 8/10

Assorted Sushi Platter: This was the star of the meal and everyone at our table ordered their own.  It comes with a sushi roll and about 8 pieces of nigiri.  I didn't care for the salmon cream cheese piece but every other one was melt in your mouth amazing.  I think it came with Toro, which was my favorite. 9/10

The sushi...mediocre at best. Started with the toro tartar. I've sampled toro all over the world, and the best toro, has a nice buttery taste that melts in your mouth. I found it to be fishy, and very small portion for the price. Now I expect to pay a decent price for toro as it's the filet mignon of fish, but 27 dollars for the portion we receive was disappointing. 

The sushi rolls. We ordered 3 rolls, and while they weren't bad tasting, we found them to be plain and basic. Needless to say, next time is Pittsburgh we will be seeking out a different venue for sushi.",japanese
761,4.0,eC0iLr5RxpZPmJ6NGSqijA,"One word: MINDBLOWING. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner and I was extremely surprised by not only the food, but our great waiter. We split every dish because we wanted to taste it all! 
We started with drinks. You can't go wrong with any of the choices! I like not being able to taste the alcohol in my drinks and these met that criteria perfectly. Not too sweet, not too sour...just great! Food was served as it was made, so there was always food coming our way!
The gyoza was crispy, hot and came with a delicious dipping sauce. It came with 5 pieces, not a ton of food but it didn't fill me up for the next food. Next came the salmon mushroom sashimi. OH MY. Honestly, I could have eaten the mushrooms alone. The teriyaki sauce that the mushrooms and salmon were seared into tasted heavenly. The salmon was sliced thinner and each was perfectly cooked. The extra sauce on the plate was then poured over rice by our waiter....even more deliciousness! Only downside was that as an entrée I was expecting a slightly larger portion. 
Next was the toro tartar. Again, as an entrée I was expecting a slightly larger portion. However, the food tasted great (no surprise based on the previous food). Lastly was the sushi. You could tell the rice was made fresh and from a great source.
For dessert we got two dishes. The first was a twist on the famous banana split. The banana was caramelized, split in two, and had three types of ice cream on a banana bread. On top was a chocolate drizzle. My favorite dessert on the entire planet. It was so good! The other dessert looked like a sushi plate but had dessert items in place of the roll, ginger, soy sauce, etc. There were pistachios, a wonderful chocolate sauce, and chocolate cake-like substitutions for the sushi rolls. Again, delicious! 
Word of advice: if you have trouble walking up/down stairs in heels don't wear them. To get to the restaurant requires going up two flights of stairs. It's not too bad walking them in heels, but just a heads up!
Another word of advice: don't go starving. Portions here are tiny, but make up in flavor. Eat a small snack before! 
Overall, great food and our waiter was super knowledgeable about everything. He answered every question and made us feel like we were well taken care of. This is an extremely pricey place, so be prepared to spend some $$$. Regardless, this is the best sushi/Japanese food I've ever had!!!",japanese

My recommendation is to try the tasting menu if you want incredible food, but order off menu if you are starving.

763,5.0,iJkKi-5NqRN1PhdI4KqjAQ,"This place used to be called Sakkio Japan and went through another name change for a short time I believe? But the people there have stayed the same for as long as I can remember (probably elementary school, so 10 years or so). And it's the same delicious chicken teriyaki.

Fast food chicken teriyaki, as a very specific style/dish, holds a very elevated place in my book, mainly because I learned to love it from this place. This is the best mall teriyaki I've ever had in the country, and I've tried a lot of places in a lot of malls/airports/train stations, etc. It's my go-to meal before traveling or mid-shopping. 

The sauce is perfect, whereas most have an overwhelming molasses smell and taste. It's the perfect saltiness to complement white rice or noodles, though fried rice is okay too. The chicken is always perfectly tenderly cooked, uniform pieces. And a huge portion for $6. I don't like their vegetables (too crunchy/bitter, and a small portion for an extra charge, and they're extra charge, so I wouldn't bother getting them. 
I guess they don't need my vouching for them, really, because the constant sample giving bring a huge line whenever there are people at the mall. A great place that has stayed great through the years. One of my permanent favorite places to eat.",japanese

The food was ok.  A little bland, though they did offer extra sauce.  I declined because I was watching calories, but maybe that would have helped.   The biggest problem was that it was hard to eat with the world's flimsiest fork and plate combo.

We walked in on a Friday night and were sat immediately. They immediately brought us water, but it took a while to get service. We did finally get a server and tried to order drinks. They don't have a liquor license so they had complimentary wine and beer. They were out of beer and only had Moscato for wine. Moscato is too sweet for me so I stuck with the water.

We ordered and all our food was good, but our service was just bizarre. Every time we asked a question we were met with weird answers or he would say yes, I'm just about to get that when clearly he'd just forgotten.

The most bizarre part was when our friend ordered a California roll and he recommended upgrading to the Flipped Roll which is a roll with mango on top. It really wasn't similar to the California roll at all?

The food was good, but I got the monster and flipped roll. Both had way too much sauce on them for my liking. If I give them another shot, I'd probably get to go food.",japanese

I honestly loved all of them and they were all different from each other. My favorite was the Okonomiyaki and Kimchi pork. I would definitely order those two again!

Although they are called Kyoto, the restaurant features foods from other regions of Japan, especially the Okonomiyaki pancakes from the city of Hiroshima. So while the owner is from Kyoto, her husband was trained to cook Okonomiyaki. 

There's a wide range of Sake, Beer and Shōchū, oddly there is no Shōchū made from sweet potatoes, which is fairly common in Japan. 

The Sakura Mochi was a delectable finish to a wonderful meal. The sweet rice cakes filled with a delicious bean paste quite hit the spot.",japanese

Small space inside makes for a pretty intimate feel. We sat at a table with some bamboo overhead, which was kind of fun and well-themed. Very friendly service!

My fiance and I got the famous pancake that the restaurant is known for - Okonomiyaki. It's a mix of cabbage, noodle, egg, whatever meats you add (for $1-3 dollars each), and is topped with fish flakes. Very good flavor and an interesting dish! Haven't ever had this kind of thing before, which made it fun. The base pancake with no add-ins is just $11.

We also got a chicken katsu plate (I am surely spelling it wrong). This was more or less chicken and gravy, but with Asian-style, curry-flavored gravy, on a large bed of white rice. So very basic on one hand, but on the other hand kind of an interesting take on chicken and gravy. Pretty filling, only $13.

The waiter was super super nice and he made sure that we were all taken care of. We ordered a bunch of small plates here and there to share with everyone. The takoyaki was so super delicious but they were all really good. As an entree we got the chicken katsu kare and I have to say, it was really mediocre. I guess you can't really do anything fancy to the dish, but it was the same as what I could make at home.

We also got a pork okonomiyaki and that was really good. Too much cabbage but it was cooked well and hot.

I think the best part was the matcha cheesecake. Unfortunately they didn't have enough for the entire party because they only make a set amount each day, but that was fine because not everyone wanted a slice anyways. But it was so so good. They also bring out ice cream with a candle for birthdays.

They have a very simple menu with only a few options to choose from each day, but they switch out the sides frequently so it never gets boring. During the lunch rush, the line can be pretty long, so you have plenty of time to ponder your choices. I like going right when they open before 12, so I can beat the crowds.

Everything I've eaten here so far has been delicious. The fried tofu in particular is addictive and I would recommend vegetarians and meat-eaters alike try this dish.

Our first thoughts about this place while walking in was that it was small but really cute! We really liked the decorations and the lights. 

My friends and I all created our own plate (""Start with"", ""Add some"", and ""Choose a Side"") and found an area to sit together in the back of the restaurant. The employee taking our order was awesome, patient, and super friendly! 

Our orders came out fairly quickly for having 9 people and everything was great! The food tasted great! Delicious, fresh, and clean - which is what we wanted because we were eating fried food the day before. One lady who worked there (I believe she was the manager) even gave us radish kimchi and cabbage kimchi on the house which was truly appreciated :).

Parking was a bit of a pain to find (probably because it was a weekend) so if you don't want to find street parking, I highly recommend you looking for a parking garage on Parking Panda or SpotHero.

I got the spicy chicken with glass noodles and seaweed salad on the side. We also ordered the Korean fried chicken. 

Spicy chicken: I got about a 4-5 spiciness, there is heat but not very hot in my opinion definitely prefer less heat than too much! Glass noodles were so GOOD. Side salad that comes with It good too-- needs more dressing it's a little dry unless you mix the entire box together

KFC: very good! Texture and chicken quality was great! Only complaint was It was an over-flavorful crisp outside which you didn't really notice if you mixed the bowl together. 

Overall, good. Not the best thing I've ever tried but everything tasted fresh and relatively healthy. The interior can be a little cramped at peak times but wow was it so cute inside!

Let's start with the good. The food at Nak Won Garden is pretty decent. Sadly, Pittsburgh is lacking in Korean fare, and Nak Won Garden serves up some solid food, although it is on the pricier side. The service was also good, at least while I was there. 

No, the reason for my unfavorable rating of this place is its dishonest business practices. The suggested tipping amounts on the check are almost astonishingly inflated, but what's even worse was that they actually went ahead and charged me for more than the amount I signed off on. If I hadn't thought to check my bank account, they would have gotten away with it, too. Wondering if maybe I had written the wrong amount on my copy of the receipt, I took a look at other Yelp reviews and saw similar stories. I'm sorry, but that's just not okay.

I am not the biggest bubble tea drinker but the drinks that I have gotten from here is pretty much on par with other tea shops in Oakland. The tapioca pearls were firm and had a nice chew to them (though they are smaller than what I'm used to). I usually just get plain iced tea when I go.

795,4.0,wUr4HeEhhPeiFb7UmiYRzg,"I swung by with a friend while I was visiting Pittsburgh and I'm glad I did! The space itself is pretty small but the food was worth it.

I ordered a snack size soy garlic as well as an almond milk tea. The milk tea was pretty average and came out pretty quickly. The chicken unfortunately took a bit longer. There were only a few orders before ours and we waited probably at least 20 minutes, which isn't super long, but is a good amount to wait in a smaller store like this. On the bright side though, it definitely meant our chicken was fresh and hot when we got it. It was worth the wait though - the chicken was flavorful, the skin was crisp, and there's was a good amount in the snack size box.

I would like to see more bubble tea options but would definitely come back! I also wished they had reusable silverware/dishes so there wasn't as much waste.",korean

The taro smoothie with boba was quite good and I was happy that the boba was still chewy unlike some places I've tried where it's begun to disintegrate before I've even had my first sip. 

The KFC is also quite good! I was in Seoul a few months back where I had my first and I think this place is pretty comparable. 

Got the Spicy soy garlic flavor and loved that there was a good amount of heat without being overpowering. 

Next time I'll probably order ahead so that I don't have to wait as long, but that being said, the food was worth the wait :)",korean

Even so, the restaurant was full of people but it looked like there was only one person making the drinks so it took longer than expected for my friend and I to receive our drinks. I noticed that all the fruit flavors were made with powdered mixes rather than actual fruit, so the flavor was a little more diluted than I would have liked.",korean

I have had both the bulgogi and pork bowls and both are so great. The bulgogi is perfectly cooked and incredibly flavorful and the sauces and sauce on the pork is next level. They're both so good, I'd recommend getting the half and half option. There is plenty of sticky rice in the bowls and lettuce in the sauces so you will be filled up. 

Each bowl is served with a dumpling and it's worth adding the side of dumplings and throwing them on top of your bowl or splitting with someone else to throw on your bowl. The kimchi is also another great side that I'd recommend throwing on top. MR Bulgogi is always awesome and you will not be disappointed!",korean

I ordered their spicy pork bowl and a side of dumplings. The spicy pork was layered with rice on the bottom, lettuce on top of that, a portion of breaded pork, and a ribbon of sauce on the top of everything. I didn't know they put dumplings on the bowl so I was excited to see they actually did.

Cost of the bowl was $10. The rice was the largest portion in the bowl (probably about 1.5 cups) and the pork portion was smaller (maybe 1/2 cup or so). But I found the bowl filling and was satisfied with the portion for lunch. I also had the side of dumplings, which definitely were worth the $4 charge.

As for the taste, the spicy pork was spot on. Spice level was similar to a spicy tuna roll in sushi terms (so a bit of a kick, but not overly spicy). The flavor was just delicious. My only critique for the pork would be to get the slices of pork a bit more crispy. Some of them were a bit on the chewy side.

The dumplings were, in a word, magnificent! The taste was delicious and they were perfectly crispy on the outside. They may have been one of the best dumplings I've ever had.

For sure will get more from this food truck when I see them again.",korean

There's no way to describe the food, except for fresh and flavorful. The dumplings have either scallions or some other herb that makes them stand out over all other dumplings I've had in the past. The tacos or bowls are bulgogi and pork and a party of well blended flavors. The yum yum/ spicy mayo they use on their bowls has a kick but it surprisingly manages to not overpower the rest of the flavors. To say I'm a little obsessed with the food would be an understatement.

We ordered the chicken dumplings for my daughter and the guy taking the orders asked us if it was for a child. When we said yes he added rice and a water with it. No extra charge! 
They had single foil sheets sitting out to make it easy to cover your food and take it to go. My pork was great! Zero complaints and there were 2 dumplings included with the bowls. My hubby said the beef was spicy but still really good.

Seats are too high for table and uncomfortable. The BBQ was great. We let the pork belly get crispy like bacon & it was delicious. The bulgogi was super tender and had good flavor. It is more expensive than I was expecting. If you are planning to do BBQ, there is a 2 lb order minimum, and it is $25+ per lb.

The restaurant itself is nothing fancy, but I promise that you won't be disappointed with the menu selection and the freshness of their food.

There is one woman who cooks the food, and prepares the sushi. She is extremely kind, and I'm assuming she is the owner. I give her major props for being able to run a business and prepare all of the food!

This restaurant is BYOB, which always is a +1 star in my book.


The sushi was so fresh, some of the best that I've had in the south hills.

Servings were plenty and we had breakfast for the next day.  Only disappointment was not having the seafood pancake on menu.   I guess I'll be staying with my Shadyside go to for that.

808,5.0,3dyO9LrC9x-qJ2ZpbL9FZA,"Soju was the best restaurant and place that I stumbled upon during my most recent trip to Pittsburgh. We met some friends here and were able to split a number of things. Everything we tried and tasted was phenomenal, and I'm psyched that we found this place.

First off, our waitress was amazing. She was super attentive, offered us free shots of soju at the end of dinner, and told us multiple times to stay as long as we'd like to continue enjoying our night and dining experience. Towards the end, the manager (maybe owner?) also came out with a huge smile on his face to greet us. Very warming.

We split the Nori Fries - absolutely amazing. From the seasoning on the fries to the sauce they came with.. perfection. The Kimchijeon (kimchi pancake) was perfectly fried, crisp, and delicious and, again, the sauce that came with it was the perfect accompaniment. For the main course, we split the Korean BBQ sample, mostly because my indecisive self can never pick just one thing. All three - the kalbi, bulgogi, and dwaejibulgogi - were phenomenal. Tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. I would recommend any of them individually, but the combo is a great chance to try all three.

What a great place to land itself in the constantly developing and trendy Pittsburgh food scene. Highly recommended.",korean

They do not take reservations... but we were able to snag a spot when some of our party let them know we'd have four arriving soon and we didn't wait at all for a table. 

The food was amazing... big portions with lots of flavors. One of us was vegetarian so we got all vegetarian appetizers and they have tons of options. 


Kimchijeon was a sweet yet savory pancake that was huge and delicious. 
Killer tofu was super crispy which I loved. The sauce that came with it we dipped everything in. 
Nori French fries .... yum. Almost like boardwalk fries with a Korean take. These were amazing and got a huge portion. 

My boyfriend and I split the Korean BBQ combination. I'll be honest... I have no idea what the meat was, but it was al tender and flavorful and perfectly cooked. 

The atmosphere was great, they essentially played a lizzo CD the whole time (thank you), but my boyfriend wasn't a fan of that. Our waitress was such a nice pleasant person who didn't rush us at all and was super helpful and accommodating.

*MEDIOCRE*

Soju puts a twist to tradition Korean food dining with the design of the restaurant and the presentation of the food. The restaurant looks very much like a cafe with the art, the hanging lights, and the wooden tables; quite aesthetic. The food menu was very limited in comparison to a standard Korean restaurant. However, the drinks menu was more extensive. It was very nice of the owner/head-chef to greet us and thank us for coming out. Overall service was great and presentation was

Soju Punch: 
A mix between soju, yakuroto yogurt, and tropical fruits. This tasted really good! Taste like an alcoholic version of Yakult/Calpico.

Korean BBQ Combination:
If you're like me and loves to try everything, get this! You get all the three meats they offer: Kalbi, bulging, and dwaejibulgogi. It comes with white rice and two banchans, kimchi and pickled cucumbers. You get three decently sized pieces of each meat: The meats were cooked and seasoned well. The sauces were on the sweet side. I liked it, but for $18, I expected a bit more stuff. The banchan included pickled cucumbers and kimchi. The pickled cucumbe was sooo good, just the right amount of sourness and sweetness. The kimchi however, was more sour than spicy.

Kimchi fried rice with egg:
The egg was perfectly cooked over easy. The fried rice was seasoned well, but it was not that spicy. The kimchi was more sour than spicy. As someone who loves sour food, I still thought it was sour. Maybe it would've been more enjoyable if it was a bit more spicy and a bit less sour. 

VERDICT:

Would I order them again? I would order the drink and the meat again, but not the fried rice.

Would I go back again? If you want me to. I'd go if my friends want to go. But I would not be the one suggesting it.",korean
811,4.0,3dyO9LrC9x-qJ2ZpbL9FZA,"Good Korean food in a slightly hipster space right along Penn Ave in Bloomfield/Friendship. They do not take reservations and the place was packed when I arrived at around 7pm on a Saturday. We only had to wait 15 minutes or so but the vibe was lively throughout our meal. Younger crowd and kind of wonky decor (pictures of large partially naked people, lots of exposed brick) all add to that feel. Service was casual and friendly.

Food is very solid. My girlfriend and I split two appetizers. The kimchi pancake was pretty standard for Korean places, but very crispy (vs. soft). It came with a very zesty dipping sauce. The Korean poutine was basically a large bowl of thick fries in a curry gravy. There were some tofu pieces that were supposed to substitute for cheese curds but didn't add much. Not sure what was Korean about this but it was tasty. We also got the bibimbap bowl which was our favorite! Plentiful mix of veggies, rice, and bulgogi beef with the spicy red sauce. So all in all the food is typical Korean but quite good.",korean
812,4.0,3dyO9LrC9x-qJ2ZpbL9FZA,"I wish I was able to give this establishment a 3.5 stars. The food is average however, the environment is cute. I think this place gets packed because of their nice, hip environment and ""different"" food most Pittsburghers are not used to.  

My friends and I ordered a lot of food. We ordered the savory pancakes, gimbap rolls, poutine, kimchi rice, pineapple salmon and bibimbap. The best by far was definitely the gimbap with the salmon a close second. 

I'm a little disappointed in the food because a lot of the food was a little soggy for me. I wish the pancake was a little crispier, it was difficult to pick up because of how soggy it was. It fell apart as soon as I tried to eat it. The poutines were very interesting in taste. I appreciated the curry sauce however, the fries were also very soggy. 

I would come back for the gimbap roll because it was very tasty, the bulgogi inside was seasoned perfectly and was sweet in flavor. The pineapple salmon was beautifully presented and there was a lot of flavor. I enjoyed it however, the ""sticky rice"" that was served under the salmon was soggy and soaked in the pineapple sauce. When I eat a rice dish, I like the varying textures. I wish there was more play on texture with these dishes.

Located on Highland Ave, this location definitely gets busy, especially on weekend nights. If you stop in earlier in the week, you'll probably be seated immediately.

For the most part, during the warmer months, you can find them on Penn Ave which is cool because you don't have to worry about missing them. They also have a few tables set up in front of the truck so you can enjoy your food when you get it. There's a window where you place your order which is separate from the window where you pick up your food. They accept credit cards which is awesome and the menu is pretty extensive for a food truck in my opinion. Staff was super pleasant and patient considering I never know what I want. I was able to pick 3 different tacos which came out to a little over 10 dollars with tax. Not bad. When I got my tacos at the pick up window, I realized they were a bit on the smaller side from what I'm used to (and I'm a taco fanatic). But I silenced the chubby girl at heart and ate the tacos.

I ordered the chicken nachos. The portions are big for the price! I was full half way through. My mom got the salad and it was crazy big. It didn't even look like she put a dent in it by the time she was full. 

We also tried their homemade hot sauces. They were all good. The only thing I missed was quac. I thought about it after we left so I guess I didn't miss it that much but I'd love to see it on the menu!

The tacos were average in my opinion. Nothing really wowed me. I ordered a lengua taco and an al pastor. I was disappointed in the pineapples on the al pastor. It seemed like they were just cubed pineapples from the can. They didn't add the fresh sweetness I typically expect from an al pastor taco.  The lengua was also sub-par. Nothing impressive to report. The tamal I ordered was the best thing I ate. The tamal was very soft and delicate however, very tasty. In wish I would've ordered three of them.

This Chipotle met all of my low expectations. The romaine was half brown which prevented me from ordering a salad (my personal Chipotle fave), and I was overcharged for my bag of chips (charged instead for chips and salsa). I asked for salsa after I saw the receipt and one employee told me ""he couldn't do that"" in an exasperated tone. To his defense, he was handling meat but I had already asked the other two employees who were actively ignoring me. Also, the chips tasted like an entire bottle of salt had accidentally been poured out on them.

I get burritos delivered to my office from Los Cabos via UberEats. They're large (Chipotle sized but not like this has anything else in common with Chipotle!) so one typically feeds me lunch for two days. There's always a side of salsa included, which is a nice touch coming from this Californian. The bottom half is wrapped in foil for a contained eating experience, and the tortilla is large enough to amply hold all the filling without coming unfolded on either end. The tortilla is also thick and stretchy enough to not break when filled.

Standard burritos come with guacamole, pico, and your choice of meat. You can add on a wide variety of toppings, however I usually keep it simple and only add beans or hot sauce. There's also a California style burrito stuffed with fries, sour cream, and cheese in addition to meat. Few places around here serve this San Diego staple, so I appreciate seeing it here. I wish there were a few more shredded meat or spicy options, but for the price and overall quality I'm a fan. I'll definitely stop in and try their other menu items if I'm ever in the area.",mexican

You order at the counter and take your seat.

I got the shrimp burrito (no special sauce as it's sour cream based) and Hubs got the chicken enchilada. We sat down and noticed each table had Heniz ketchup, but not all tables had hot sauce. Yes, Pittsburgh meets Mexican.

We are given chips and salsa and warned the chips were hot. Definitely made fresh, so nice touch. I enjoyed the salsa as it had a good hint of spice. Our food arrives within a reasonable timeframe. The burrito was very much there, no tin foil, making me wonder how to eat it. Bite in and find good garlic flavor with the shrimp. There's nothing more than shrimp and rice. No lettuce or tomato dices. I should have read the menu more clearly as all is as described. Don't assume. There was a lot of shrimp and each bite included a taste of shrimp, so positive. On the chicken enchilada, Hubs thought it was average. The flavors were good, but a generic sense overall.

It's a good neighborhood spot and the service is great. Definitely not an authentic place and the blend with the city's food culture isn't for me. I'll probably be back as the occasion warrants as the service is friendly and food is average.",mexican

There's one super spicy salsa that's deep red with a bunch of pepper seeds in it. When I went to scoop some onto my taco the man behind the flattop warned me ""very spicy"". And he was right!

For $14 it is a hell of a lot of good food. It was at least 2, usually 3 meals for me and I eat a lot.  love it!",mexican

Great deals on Tuesdays, $1 hard shell tacos with beef or chicken, and $2 off margaritas during happy hour during the week.

Impossible crumbles ( which were delicious ) brought me in ! The lack of customer service is what drove me out . Probably won't be back for a while ! 

I walked in to this establishment at 9:52. I was then greeted with ""what can i get you real quick?"" . I then asked "" What time do you all close ?"", the employee quickly responded ""you got eight minutes!"" 

Okay I get it I've worked in food service before myself and nobody likes those customers who straggle in at the last minute. (In my defense I genuinely didn't know that they closed so early. The QDOBA in Kansas City used to stay open to 3am on weekends. *cough cough* maybe a good suggestion to bring in some foot traffic from the crazy Carson crowds.) 

Anyways back to the review I immediately apologized and said that I wasn't aware of that. Hoping that this would clear some of the tension. Nope it didn't. For those of you all that are not familiar the restaurant is set up similarly to chipotle where you build your own burrito, nacho, taco salad etc.  That being said I can't Phaethon the reason for the major attitude.

I added chicken at the last minute.  I picked out all of the items that I wanted on my nachos and paid for my meal.  I looked for a table to sit at but the ones that weren't occupied needed wiped off.  I finally wiped on off myself.  I sat down to eat.  I looked down at my nachos and became disappointed.  They had not strained the chicken before putting it in with my toppings and the grease from the chicken had pooled on top of my nachos.  I was hungry so I ate around it.

It is a nice family owned Mexican restaurant in the Lebanon Shops. The dim lighting and neat deco make for a nice, comfortable atmosphere. The staff is beyond accomodating. We not only had our waitress come to our table but another waitress and the cook to check on us and offer suggestions of what to try. I expressed my love of spicy sauces. Our waitress warned me about the one she brought to try at our table and I loved it. She even gave me tortilla chips and two containers of the sauce to go home. It was delicious. 

***Please note if you do not like the salsa that is given (seemed very tomato sauce based and very thin) with the complimentary tortillas - tell your waiter/waitress and she will have no problem getting you a spicy one - she got me some and it was amazing. 

My friend tried the pork carnitas and I tried the shrimp quesadillas. We each got the margaritas. I like that you can choose top shelve tequila for an extra $3 to add to the quality of your drink. I had the mango with Jose Cuervo - let me just tell you how fresh the mangoes are! They are the sweet mangoes that you can't find easily in the area. The drink was better than any other margarita I ever had - no lie.

The food was mouthwatering and we had it within 10-15 minutes tops. I cannot wait to come back. The service, food, and environment - you could not ask for more. They are very friendly and seem like great people. I added menu photos and some of our food! The prices are extremely reasonable $10-$17 per person --- this is very common pricing for this type of food and the quality is worth it. Probably one of,  if not the most authentic Mexican restaurants in the area.",mexican

The absolute most bland ""Mexican"" food I've ever had. I make more flavor in my kitchen at home. I had a combination plate with a beef fajita, ground beef taco, and a chicken enchilada with a side of refried beans and rice. The beans were the best part of it, likely because they came straight from a can. The rice tasted exactly like the microwave Uncle Ben's Spanish rice, neither beef was flavored, and the chicken was painfully dry. I also ordered a frozen margarita but it was frozen to the point that it was nearly a block of ice plus I feel like the alcohol content was minimal, if there was any alcohol at all. I'm sure I should have taken the hint when I walked in and was one of two customers.",mexican
902,3.0,vpwyL6NHm-pTWJ5IeJb9yw,"It's good. It's what I would call a traditional Mexican restaurant. They have appetizers (cheese dip, guacamole, etc.), they have specialties, and they have combos and sides. 

The chips are very good, warm, thin, and crisp. The salsa is very good but not spicy. 

Service is friendly and quick. The only negative is the pricing, which is a bit high for what it is. Dinner combos are $12-$15. You'll leave well fed; portions are pretty large, but at this price-point, they are competing with more upscale restaurants in the area.",mexican

They're also pretty sloppy and messy, and they literally were just arguing with each other through the whole order. And this has been relatively representative of the last 3 or 4 times I've come here. I won't be coming back to this one.

They were completely out of red onions and peppers (a new batch was on the grill but would've taken another 5 minutes wait).

THEY LITERALLY NEVER HAVE CHIPS!!!! Or hard taco shells for that matter. I've either ordered through door dash, Postmates, or most recently gone in store and literally the last 5 times they have been out of chips and hard tacos. There's no way I'm that unlucky that this has happened to me 5 times in a row. They're always out of other stuff too like beans etc, but the chips thing is absurd. I'm not usually a complainer, I've waitressed, I know how food prep works, so I feel like there's no way that they should be out of that much stuff all the time if people are paying attention and not waiting till the last minute to restock (not trying to sound like a Karen but come on). And I get the service industry sucks sometimes but the employees usually seem really annoyed to have customers. Also check when you order delivery and try to get a different location, my order is almost always missing something or wrong, mistakes happen but this is a consistent thing.

Employee then threw a little shade at the girl who made my order and she again told her what I had ordered. Anyway, I was already slightly irritated with the experience and ordered to go. As I'm sitting in a chair clear as day to the girl behind the register I hear her say ""where is this lady?"" It was so rude.

I think that this place just needs to close for a couple of months and renovate. I hate to be too candid, but upon entering, that place smelled like a public restroom. Upon walking upstairs to the seating are, the smell faded somewhat, but not really. It was just very dense and warm in there...the place needs some ventilation.

I decided to only order chips and quac, which were actually very tastey and they give you a large portion (and we sat close to the open patio, which allowed me to breath some fresh air, if only for a minute or two). We also had the Friday $10 margarita pitcher, and it was pretty good and relatively strong! They went a little heavy on the sour mix, but I didn't mind. 

Our server was super friendly and was trying to accommodate us well, so I appreciated that! But I just couldn't get over the smell and humidity. I (grudgingly) went to use the restroom and (not to my surprise) it was pretty gross. There was a giant hole in the ceiling that was leaking and splattering an unidentifiable liquid everywhere, and the toilets and stalls were old and just gross.

Fajitas were served lukewarm, the flavor was awful, like someone mixed curry paste and chili powder and had just dumped it over chicken, peppers, and rice.

Service was AWFUL! We were asked about 4 times if we had decided what we wanted to eat in a span of about 6 minutes, and then we did not see our server for about 20 minutes!!

To get started, we went for the $10 margarita pitchers, which were decent. The mango and strawberry flavors were fairly sweet and could have been a tad stronger. Next, we got the dip trio. The pineapple salsa was good, the queso was average, but the guacamole was too bland. It needed salt, lime, and cilantro. To boot, their chips are too plain as well.

For an entree, I went for the pricey Molcajete Bowl. The lava rock bowl is pretty neat. It is, as stated, EXTREMELY hot. My food was simmering for at least 20-30 minutes I believe. It was a very tasty and hot dish, maybe too hot for an already hot day. It comes with 4 small tortillas, which was not enough. Regardless, I really liked this dish and I would order it again.

Originally a taco truck, then a small restaurant space and truck, La Palapa is now a great restaurant and bar space (and truck) located on East Carson by the Birmingham Bridge.

We've tried different items off the menu, and I've yet to be disappointed.

The first time I stopped here I was treated like garbage, by a high school kid. I blamed myself for having a bad day and tried giving them the benefit of the doubt by 1- not reviewing them and 2- trying to come back. 

Guess what? I tried again and AGAIN I was completely disrespected by yet another a high school kid.


Today, the employee had the audacity to say (under her breath, that I could clearly hear) ""oh sure anything you want"" LIKE RELLY? I didn't know a to go order of tacos could spark such outrage. 

I will never come here again. Also, I guarantee if you try this location you will be equally as disappointed and disrespected.",mexican

What I like is that I can get it my way.   I ordered  a bowl - Double Chicken, Pinto Beans, Lettuce, Grilled Vegetables, and Medium hot sauce.

The meal met my expectations and kept me full for the rest of the day.   

Price - less than $10
Atmosphere - Standard Chipotle (crushed and a little dirty but not to the fault of the establishment)
Parking - the parking is a little crowded because of competing businesses.

I asked if I could have it remade with a different batch of gauc and the preteens working the counter said no. Ok, well screw me then. 

The staff obviously doesn't care and they'll remake your food but only with half the portion size of the regular meal. It's a disappointing experience. Go somewhere else for $30 fast food or drive to a different location, you'll be better off.  As a suggestion: Panera, Five Guys, Firehouse, and Burgatory all flank this chipotle.

It was old rice, bean juice, and veggies all down the counter. While I was paying, I asked ""Why is this counter so nasty"" the response was ""We've been swamped"" (it was 50 minutes before closing) Although disgusted,  I paid and left. I went next door to Walmart to grab water and chips (because Chipotle was out of chips). After leaving Walmart I thought to myself ""Oh no, I'm not eating this"" My brain just couldn't phathom me enjoying that meal.  I went back and told them I wanted my money back because the place was filthy and I couldn't imagine what took place during the food prep. They looked at me like I was crazy. Like the nerve of YOU to bring food back to our disgustingly filthy establishment! She reluctantly gave me a refund. I asked if she was the manager on duty and she said ""yes"". I asked,  ""Why don't y'all clean this up?"" She just starred at me with a silly stuck look on her face.

We were greeted immediately upon entering and we decided to grab a seat at the bar.  They have TVs, so it's easy to catch the game while enjoying some quick grub.

We order a few tacos and they came out pretty fast, maybe 10 minutes or so.  They have lots of toppings on them and they were a pretty decent size.  My only gripe we're that they were a little cold, but they were still good.

My go-to taco is the shrimp.  That one is delicious!!  The flavors are balanced out nice and the shrimp is seasoned well. 

The place has a nice vibe and the workers are very friendly.  The owner also came out, walked around and asked everyone how they were doing and he was very friendly.  Overall, it's a great add to the community and I'm sure we'll be back soon.",mexican
949,2.0,q6vyGObMjAhGBN9I1nyACA,"I write this review without any malice, I simply hope that my suggestions help steer this local business in a better direction so it can be the best it can be! We wanted to try this place out to see how it was, seeing as how this area desperately needs more restaurants that aren't fast food.

The service was wonderful and I have no complaints. It was speedy, efficient, wonderful staff. 

The food was a different story. I ordered the Bellevue Bowl and asked for them to substitute the chipotle crema instead of the avocado aioli. When it arrived, the first thing I noticed was how terrible the presentation was. It looks like a sloppy brown jumbled mess. Gordon Ramsay would not have been happy. It tasted adequate, nothing special, nothing about it made me want to try more on the menu. Another thing was that the caramelized onions that were served in it were cold. In fact, the entire bowl seemed to have different temperatures depending on what you bit into. The shrimp was good, albeit a bit room temperature, the other meats were a little hot, the corn and rice was lost in the room-temperature sauce as well. It was very disappointing. I basically just ate the meat and left the rest as it was just not appetizing. The actual utensils, plates, bowls etc are all plastic, cheap and easily disposable. No real restaurant quality utensils or tableware. The margarita I had was still $5 even during happy hour, which was $1 less than usual. And with that mango margarita I ordered, it was at least 50% ice, about 25% mango flavoring, and probably somehow less than 15% alcohol. The rest tasted watered-down. That was very disappointing as well. My partner ordered 3 of the Mama's Taco, one soft-shell, two hard-shell. He said he would rather have gone to Taco Bell, a sad thing. His tacos had rice at the base which seems like a good idea but it was just regular unseasoned white rice. Nothing authentic about it. He could not finish all 3 tacos and decided not to take the remainder home. 

The menus look like a middle schooler attempted them in an amateur graphic design class. We had to turn the menu upside down every time we turned it over because one side was always the wrong way. Very unprofessional, again, no authenticity, and difficult to read with the weak ink and colors. 

The one (and only) bathroom is unisex and has no decor, just a sad small room. Everything just needs spruced up. More professionalism is needed to make this place deserving of a ""hometown taco"" name. The people in this area deserve better and I hope that with the business they have received, that they use that to make it better and better. We will try them again sometime in the future and I very much hope that positive changes will have been made. 
¡Buena suerte!",mexican

 The food isnt the biggest down fall of this place because that can always be improved . The customer service sucks and our waitress seemed like she was high on something.

Our server told us that he typically works on the line, but he and his girlfriend switched places tonight and he was serving for the first time ever. Let's just say he left a lot to be desired in the serving department, but our food was good. Unfortunately, they were out of pico de gallo and I am not sure how that happens at a mexican restaurant?!

We started with margaritas and an order of chips and guac. My guac was good, but the chips were nothing special or homemade. My friend had queso that was borderline cold. The margaritas on the rocks were good, but the frozen ones were excessively sweet, and that's coming from a sweet tooth girl! 

Finally, our tacos came out and saved the day! They were huge and delicious. I tried Mama's Taco and the Buffalo Chicken Taco. I really enjoyed them both and $3 for a taco that big?! Sold.

I also love the vegan and vegetarian options they give you and feel very impressed with the vegan tacos. I also love the half foil and half cardboard boxes they put foods in as it gives you choices for heating it up later.

I'm still knocking them off a couple stars though because some of the chips were stale and sometimes the food is just overly salty - also not impressed with the cheese dip. Furthermore, the lemonade does not have fresh lemons. They still have a lot of great choices though so I think they should just take off the less great ones ;) Oh yeah, someone else mentioned that their burritos tend to leak a lot of water - that's actually a thing too.",mexican

I don't even ask for anything special and they're being rude. But this afternoon, I didn't recognize any of the previous employees and the service was fantastic.

We parked and walked up ... the restaurant was not crowded but took a bit to get seated .. sounded like a crowd was in the back and may have been the cause of the full lot.  

We get seated and boom....chips and salsa drop in the table .. yea!!!  Our waiter introduces himself - takes our drink order - then the food (I got a burrito and my friend the chicken fajita - no onions). We also got a bowl of queso ( thought it was a little pricey for the size bowl you get .. $4.50)

Food comes .. mine is fine .. my friend had to sent back because it can with onions.  About 10 min later she gets her's (and it right) and we can eat. 

After we were done with our means we packed up the left overs and asked for a desert menu .. just to see what they had. Typical Mexican treats like flan, fried ice cream and soppapias are on the menu and the prices were typical to others we have seen ( about $7 for fried ice cream and you pick from like 8 toppings)

As you get seated, they serve you with free chips and salsa which by the way is great when the chips are still hot. I ordered the two combo with a burrito and a tamale.

Happy hour is from 4-6, so good to know for next time. We ordered Sam Adams, but learned that they were out. We choose house margaritas on the rocks instead. They were sizable and generous with tequila. Not bad for $8.

For dinner, we ordered enchiladas suizas and flautas as entrees. I asked for no sour cream on mine, but they ended up leaving it out for both of us. My partner in crime didn't notice it was missing, so that was fine. On the menu, the entrees we ordered are described as coming with a side salad, but only one salad came out. Service just seemed a bit off and is really why I'm saying three stars.

Before I could even finished the salad, the entrees arrive. We were shocked at how quick they came out, but they came out hot (we were cautioned about touching the plates). Food wise, it was pretty good. Chips and salsa are complementary. I could have used some more salsa as we ran out before the food arrived. The meat in the flautas were a bit more dry than I hoped for. The beef tip was much better than the chicken, which needed a bit more flavor. The enchiladas are all chicken and well flavored. The side of rice that the entrees came with was fluffy and complemented the meals well. 

The portions were huge. We each only ate half our meals, so plenty of leftovers. I'll definitely come back to see how they work through some of the issues. Seems like a friendly spot and pretty good Mexican food for this city.",mexican

The location is rarely stocked with the all of the offerings one can expect from Chipotle. If they aren't out of fajita vegetables, it will be the black beans. If it isn't the black beans, it will be the Barbacoa. If it isn't the Barbacoa, it will be the lettuce (seriously a Mexican restaurant with no lettuce).

Lest I forget, this location is borderline filthy. Food scraps everywhere on the service line, tables unclean, drink spills all over the service station. Not to mention the immediate exterior of the building is a trash pickup area for what must be all of Craig St. It's pretty disgusting.

Today, I picked up my bowl and brought it home, only to find that they did not include the steak I ordered. I am not sure whether they ran out of steak or just forgot to put it in, but there was no note left on the order mentioning that they were unable to provide the protein I had paid for. This is, of course, in addition to my bowl being fajita-less, which has been the case for the past five bowls I've ordered from this Chipotle, despite having selected fajitas on the app each time.

Ordering is a sinch, and expedited by the helpful, friendly folks working behind the counter. It starts with a few basic questions, like ""burrito or bowl?"" And you get to see them put everything together deli style, right in front of you. The checkout process can be confusing though, because there always seems to be an assumption that you are going to get sides like extra chips and small drink. You do usually have to clarify which extras you want.

The food is excellent and hot-served quickly. The sparse, industrial architectural styling does not detract from the dining experience, as it gives a very modern metropolitan feel to the old-world fare.",mexican

However, the last time I came here I had a really unpleasant experience. We waited about 20min for a table for 2, which turned out to be high-top near the bar in the back patio. I was happy to be outside - enjoying the last few weeks of nice weather. Unfortunately, there was some sort of bar crawl going on, and the bar area was quite crowded. I didn't really mind the noise, but people in the bar area kept sitting drinks down on our table. As the night progressed, nearby patrons started setting down food (specifically their plates of half-eaten tacos and burritos) on our table. This was extremely awkward, and considering we had explicitly waited for a table, really frustrating

I'm not quite sure how the servers would have handled the situation - I like to think they would have done something. As it was, I think there were not enough servers, since no one seemed to notice.

The restaurant itself is uniquely dated, it adds to the experience.

There is a Mexican and a Venezuelan menu... we came hungry and tried both.  Mexican we started with chips and salsa which were weirdly overpriced, but great homemade salsa.  Venezuelan side we got tequenia's, which are such an awesome version of Italian cheese sticks.  Served with a sauce that has thousand island hints.  Also got a shredded chicken empanada that was delish!

For entree's, Mexican we got the super burrito, which was truly SUPER. It's huge and packed with ingredients.  We got the shrimp, but may get shredded beef next times.  On the Venezuelan side I got the Pabellon arepa.  The sweetness of the plantain was so unique with the shredded beef.

Anxious to try the restaurant when I heard it was owned by the same who runs Io Cafe only to be sadly disappointed that it doesn't measure up to its sister cafe across the street. In one sentence, the entire experience was flat and bland. 

First sign of trouble...food came out in two minutes. Usually we all feel like we hit the lottery when we are lucky to receive fast service but if I want food kept it steam tables I'll go to chipotle.

Ordered chips and guacamole; chips are fresh fried to they're hot but the guacamole was basic smashed avocado and I think I saw a glimpse of one piece of chopped red onion. 

Carnitas taco... terribly soggy, zero flavor. 
Crispy Cod taco was a piece of fish most likely pre-frozen pre-breaded... and they do a good job of hiding it under some mango salsa which was the only item with flavor. 

Each taco is about $3-$6 dollars, rice and beans are $3 chips and salsa... extra. Two meals with chips and guacamole no drinks.. $34. Go to chipotle",mexican

In the last month or so things have changed, and not for the better. The margaritas are awful, bitter tasting due to too much lime or other changes in their mix. It seems the wait staff have become the bartenders.

The food is hit or miss.  The guacamole is bland.  Some of the sauces are less vibrant than before. And, what is up with all the mismatched paper containers for the food. It feels like we're at the food court in the mall, instead of a neighborhood restaurant.

I can appreciate that restaurants need to make changes at times. But, it seems as if they tossed out a number of things that were good only for the sake of change.",mexican
1002,2.0,Z5LyFZUazPQ1x_i6HsS3vw,"I live close to Taco Diablo and it frequently comes up in the many ""where should we eat?"" discussions I find myself a part of.  While it finally won the battle, I wouldn't say it won the war.

My partner in dining crime and I started off with an order of nachos.  The chips were crisp and generously topped with black beans, guacamole, queso - which was delicious - and our protein of choice: brisket.  Now, it takes a LOT for me or my SO to comment that something is salty... but this brisket was borderline inedible. I picked around a good bit of it to find the chips that were slathered in the cheese/bean/guacamole goodness.  I'd definitely order these again, but perhaps with the chicken or taco beef instead.  I appreciated that the protein was included and not a separate upcharge.

Next up were a shared order of four tacos:

Grilled Chicken - this is your basic grilled chicken taco, folks.  No frills, it's topped with a smooth crema, diced tomatoes, cheese, and lettuce.  They definitely skimped on the toppings, as the lettuce, cheese, and tomato almost felt like a garnish rather than a part of the dish.  However, I did quite like the cheddar cheese they use.

Chicken Al Pastor - this was probably the most disappointing of the lot.  I remarked during our meal that it looked like it was missing something and that I thought there were more toppings listed on the menu.  Sure enough, we missed out entirely on the avocado and cilantro... and the ""al pastor"" was nothing more than diced pineapple on top of some grilled chicken.  Definitely not worth the $5 price tag.

Crispy Cod - sadly, this crispy cod was not crispy at all and was missing the napa cabbage listed on the menu.  The mango salsa was a nice touch... but if you're going to bill something as being ""crispy,"" it damn well better be crispy. 

Loaded Crispy Potato - this taco also contained the aforementioned brisket.  Aside from the salt quotient, this taco was decent and the most plentiful of the bunch.  The iO sauce packed a punch.

I'm sad that this experience wasn't better... I will say the nachos were good minus the brisket, my margarita was tasty, and the company was superior. It could've been an off night, but my first visit here left a good bit to be desired for the $55 price tag.",mexican

Aside from outstanding service, the hard shell tacos were so crunchy-good, stuffed to the hilt with fresh lettuce, ground beef, shredded cheese and tomatoes, that I was happy to overlook the iceberg they use (I mean, seriously, who's going to trot out the Arugula for a taco?).

On Tuesdays, hard shell tacos are $1/ea. The softshells are$1.50/ea.

The chili was lukewarm, and I like my chili hot. I did not ask for them to heat it up in their microwave bc we never use microwaves and certainly don't expect use of microwave when dining out.

1017,4.0,fOiEnLJk4qnp8j7onjvm4A,"My husband and I stopped over here after reading about their homemade Popsicle. They have outdoor seating here and inside is a small cafe with seating area. The  entire menu is in Spanish so you have to ask the counter lady to interpret everything for you.

They do serve lunch items here including tacos all for a reasonable price. BTW some of the prices aren't listed on the board I was looking at so you have to ask. The is a listing of prices for food items.  Their specialty is both their homemade popsicles and homemade Mexican ice cream.

I did ask about vegan options. Some of the popsicles are made using water instead of milk and I was told they would be in the first row of the freezer I was looking at. They carry standard flavors but also unusual ones such as chili with mango Popsicle or strawberry and creme Popsicle. I decided to go with the latter. Popsicles sell for $2.50 each. My husband got a lime one.

We sat down to eat them and man they were nearly frozen solid! But I must admit they were delicious!! These are real strawberries in there so that would be my recommendation if you like them. My husband was also pleased with his lime Popsicle.

I had learned from talking with her that the ice cream is made differently than the Popsicle so wanting to further taste out their products I ordered 2 scoops of peaches and cream-real peaches to boot. Again, she does serve one vegan ice cream but did not exactly find out which one it was.

My husband did the same and when we went to eat them nearly broke our plastic spoons! Nevertheless we were able to work through that and had one of the most enjoyable homemade ice cream we ever tasted. Ice cream for 2 scoops also sells for $2.50.

In addition to a refrigerator with drinks she has homemade pineapple drink, another fruit based and the third I couldn't recall.

Needless to say shortly after we started eating our ice cream this place was packed! I saw a waitress bring out some tacos to a family and they did look good.

I like the authentic Mexican feel to this place but having English definitions on the menu board as well as pricing on all boards would help a great deal since I expect this newly opened small business will be a big draw. For the sake of the food we enjoyed I bumped up this rating because we were so pleased with our treats.

1018,5.0,S8VRQCBrbZI04zjCOc1RAA,"This is a hidden jewel located as part of a Mexican grocery on Atwood right off Forbes that UPitt students are fortunate to have near them.

As a Texan, I've grown up having had a lot of tacos because it's prevalent everywhere, whether it be Austin, Dallas, Houston, etc. Y'all Pittsburgians (Yinzers?) have it lucky to have some really authentic, delicioso tacos up in the north.

Tacos are 2.50 each and you pay for them in the grocery (which also sells a bunch of other Mexican grocery items if you are lacking). The guy outside cooking them asks what you want for your order, and you can either ask him what they have (usually beef, carnitas, barbacoa, and chicken right then and there), or you can ask him to fire up some ribeye steak for you (extra 3 minutes but so so worth it).

Unlimited toppings outside include a mildly spicy guacomole sauce, mild and spicy sauces, tomatoes (pico), onions, cilantro, hot peppers, limes and more. Once you load up on toppings, its best you eat the tacos while they're still piping hot - they tend to fall apart if they get too cold.",mexican
1019,5.0,S8VRQCBrbZI04zjCOc1RAA,"I was shocked at how big the tacos were considering how cheap they were! I paid $7.50 for 3 tacos, but I think 2 tacos would be plenty.

I am someone who doesn't eat meat very often and is a little bit picky when it comes to meat, but the meat here is well-cooked and perfectly seasoned. I especially liked the chicken tacos. 

The ordering process is a little bit unique, but it's pretty easy if you know what you're doing. You just have to go inside first and let them know how many tacos you want at the register, and then head outside and pick your meats. There is a topping bar right outside so you can add your own guac, salsa, etc. 

The salsas were super spicy, but the flavors were delicious and the spice did not take away from the flavor at all. You get 2 tortillas per taco, and the corn tortillas are warm and flavorful. 

Would definitely recommend this place!",mexican
1020,4.0,S8VRQCBrbZI04zjCOc1RAA,"** Cheap and solid taco place with a topping bar to customize your tacos! Crispy but soft taco shells add a nice flare.

Las Palmas is definitely a solid taco spot that tastes pretty authentic and is only $2.50 a taco, so its a solid choice for students. Its a bit further from the bus stop on Fifth, but on warmer days its worth the trip. In order to get tacos, you need to go into the grocery store and let the cashier know how many tacos you want, and after paying you will get a receipt that you take to the stand outside. The person at the stand will then take your receipt, and then you tell him what toppings you want. 

I really like how they put the soft taco shells on the pan for a bit to give it a nice crispy texture to it. My favorite protein hands down is the ground beef, which is on the saltier side but I think goes very well with the guac, onions, cilantro, and salsa in the topping bar. Drizzle in a hint of lime and your in business ;). 

The ribeye is definitely worth trying, but it can get pretty oily, and I have a feeling they don't always want you to get it because it's a more expensive protein that they tuck away and they cook on the spot but its for sure an option to try out. 

I also like how they allow you to put as many toppings as you want to cater to your unique tastebuds. That being said... WARNING: Some of the hot salsas are super hot and will burn your butt so be careful!! Of course, the pico de gallo that just looks like straight tomato, the onions, and the guac are all safe which is what I usually go with. For the other salsas, I'd strongly advise you put them into the containers above the toppings so that you can test them first before dumping them all over your tacos. I've friends who've eaten the hottest salsa for losing a bet and they've told me you feel the burn twice - once down ur mouth and another when you use the restroom... 

The main downsides are that 1) this place has closed down a few times due to health concerns (maybe twice) so eat at your own risk, however I've eaten here several times and have been fine and 2) the tacos definitely do get soggy over time so eat them while they're fresh! Sometimes I do have to say the tacos and/or protein can become pretty oily so sometimes its a bit hit or miss, but overall its solid enough to keep me coming back.",mexican

Las Palmas has the best authentic tacos you can get in Pittsburgh. In my opinion, there's a lot of taco spots in Pittsburgh that tries to do too much with their tacos, by putting way too much as toppings and extras. 
Sometimes, SIMPLICITY IS BEST.

They're super cheap and close to the price of tacos you can get in California ($2.50). It's a crime to pay over $4 per taco.

I spoke to one of the staff who told me that it is their hope that once their sister establishment ""Provision"" closes both they and this place hope to relocate somewhere in Lawrenceville.

I had just finished lunch at another Federal Galley restaurant and wanted to get dessert here. They had a dark chocolate Mexican pudding that was served in a jar for $7.00. I know this is fairly pricey but decided to try it anyway. 

The lady served it to me right off. It was very good and I could taste the dark chocolate throughout. it wasn't overly filling and made a perfect ending to the lunch I had. I was glad for the opportunity of at least trying one of their offerings.

Another restaurant concept is slated to go in this spot this summer. For those who haven't been to Federal Galley in some time, there are major changes going on here. Wishing best of luck to all the staff of El Lugar. We will miss you!",mexican

The saltiness of the cojita cheese on top tied it all together. 

Boyfriend had the chorizo and eggs and he said it was some of the best chorizo he's ever had and I trust his opinion on that. Boy gets chorizo anytime he can.

I'm currently craving the Hot Mess daily. It's one of their brunch items. I believe it may be on the main menu all the time, but don't quote me on that. All I know is that when it's on the menu, get it. It's basically a magical mix of nacho's, mole, cotija, potatoes and an egg. So freakin' good! I've also had their pork enchilada's, which are equally as phenomenal and a super hearty helping.

My coworkers and I loved it so much, we came back a second day in a row. I've gotten the burrito, which was HUGE. I couldn't finish it all. It was packed with rice and beans, onion, peppers, beef and everything in between. I also tried the beef empanada which was clearly very homemade and good!! We also shared chips queso/guac. Queso is so creamy and jalapeño and guac was very flavorful!

The second day I got the mole enchiladas and street corn. SO GOOD. Flavorful and satisfying. You can taste all the elements of the mole. And the street corn was sweet and creamy and a little spicy. 

I can't wait to literally try everything on their menu. Not only does this place have great food, it's run by Edgar (I am assuming) and two other ladies. They are always so sweet and nice! Can't wait to tell everyone about this place and to go back!",mexican

The nachos with the queso dip and guacamole dip were the perfect appetizer. Both dips as well as the chips had a unique flavor and texture and really impressed us. The dips were very creamy and reminiscent of the flavors they were suppose to represent with the perfect level of kick to them. The chips were freshly made and had a uniquely soft crunch to them.

The chicken quesadilla was HUGE and was big enough for both of us which we both felt was a great deal for the price. Succulent chicken, a toasty tortilla, melted cheesiness and some veggies to add freshness is exactly what you look for in a chicken and cheese quesadilla. 

We look forward to coming back here soon and trying some of the other delicious food on the menu.",mexican

The people on the food truck were lovely. They had 4 types of salsa, forks and napkins readily available. I added the medium salsa to a portion of my taco, and it went very well with it. I hope I see this truck around again sometime!",mexican
1046,4.0,TcCWYYL6FxBTT6KrxabwRg,"This place was such a hole in the wall, but really good. It's actually a lot bigger than I was expecting. You walk-in, order from the menu on the wall, and then wait at a table with the number they give you. They shout out the # when the food is ready and with a simple wave of your number the waitress found me and brought out my food. Since the ordering is at the front and there was only 1 cashier, the line got a bit long since my group was about 20 and there were also other patrons. This occurred around 3:00 on a sunny Saturday.

The food was really cheap, and it was good. I could have gone for more food since it wasn't a huge serving, but it hit the spot and accomplished what I set out for. There's also free chips with guac and queso.

The inside had lots of decorations drafting down from the ceiling, as well as stuff on the walls. It made it feel like an authentic Mexican place. There was also futbol playing from the World Cup which added to that element.

The owner said that the liquor license was delayed about a month. I wasn't able to order a Corona, but anticipate by late July or August that the drafts will be flowing. At least I hope so for their sake. Either way, it's a cool place to check out near the strip.",mexican

The menu has a few tacos that are 2 for $5.00 but most of the selections are $3.50.  My barbacoa and chorizo tacos were good but not anything special.  The sauce bar is nice but it was a little messy when I was getting my sauces; thought it probably doesn't take much for just one person to spill stuff on the bar.  The place is kind of amusing with all the menus pasted on a board behind the cash register and you can see some of the kitchen staff cooking.

If this was the food truck it would be a dramatically different story.but to be honest I was quite underwhelmed going to Doce Taqueria. I don't see all the hype. They are just 3 dollar tacos... it isn't bad I would say it's just decent.

What puts it at a 3/5 is the space. You are stuck in an extremely crammed area which can't seat more than 10 people. An the menu is unapproachable since I had no idea what half of the options on the menu exactly are. If they had a description of what the options where like most other foreign restaurants it would help it dearly.",mexican

I have been to this place several times before, but now being a vegetarian, i thought that it may be more of a challenge to find something that would fit what I was able to eat besides shrimp fajitas. Well I was wrong. I ended up ordering the Fajitas del mar. This was a combo of shrimp, scallops, and langostino with vege's, rice and beans. It also says that it comes with a salad, but the salad is really the toppings for the fajitas. This was a nice big size that will get you full with a great taste.

To top it all off i was sat at a booth that shared a wall that had the margarita maker on the other side so i got to hear ice being ground in the blender the whole time.

This is the only Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh that compares with the Mexican I had in Cabo.

1059,3.0,UkylJaNbvMENvL61dgwdLg,"Not bad at all here.  There are some inconsistencies with the amount I have gotten for the steak fajitas I normally order.  

Pluses:

-open later than 9 pm. I work late and get off late and it is hard to find places that are decent after 9 pm.

-service is decent

-steak fajitas are good; the tortillas and rice/beans go well with the order

-they have Mexican soda (Jarritos)

-Tres Leches dessert!  the only place I found so far that has it AND makes it right.

Minuses:

-Portions of meat sometimes could be adequate and sometimes insufficient

-Chips are free but sometimes feel like they're stale

I did not want lukewarm, soggy, chicken tacos.  I am sad.",mexican

Personal favourite is the breaded tofu that you can put in any bowl, salad, or burrito. It's very flavourful and it's a nice change from the average bland tasting tofu at other similar places. 

The problem is, they still have a policy against outside containers. There are ways around this as many places allow their own containers nowadays. As an airline employee who travels to many airports I can confirm that many places allow it. Health and safety concerns can be addressed. This is completely ridiculous in this day and age. Their containers are very bulky and large; and recyclable or not single use items should be a choice not a requirement. If customers want to reduce the waste they are creating by bringing their own container, they should have the right to do so!",mexican

YUCCA BOWL!

The yucca bowl is delicious. The yucca fries are golden and crispy. The pico and green onions are a nice touch. The cheese sauce is yummy. I am vegetarian so order it without chorizo. What makes the bowl though is the jalapeños. I like jalapeños but don't necessarily get super excited, except about these. I order extra. They are beer braised so they have a sweet heat to them that is beyond yummy!

The place definitely has a fun vibe to it. It is bright and comfortable. They have a restaurant side with tables and booths and a bar side. We sat at the bar. It was a Wednesday night but it was still pretty dead inside. We grabbed a couple of seats at the bar. The bartender was friendly and helpful.

My boyfriend and I each ordered a cocktail. We weren't there for happy hour unfortunately. Most cocktails are around $10. He ordered the Frida Kahlo which had Hypnotiq and pomegranate juice. It was pretty tasty. I ordered a lavender margarita. It had good flavor. However it tastes a bit watered down and didn't feel like it was worth the price. In the future I will order something different and try to stick to happy hour for cocktails.

Without fail I will be back for a yucca bowl. I haven't tried a whole lot else on their menu although it does seem they have a few more vegetarian options than they previously did so maybe we will try some other things.",mexican
1069,3.0,erx8tQ0Wdc5YM0FddaKqKA,"We stumbled into Tres Rios one Friday evening because it looked fun and inviting. Service was friendly and fairly attentive, and we were happy to hear their happy hour specials were still happening. My husband had their house margarita, which was pretty average and yummy and only $5. The happy hour special basically allowed me to pick and choose different tacos, instead of choosing a platter with only one type. I chose the pato (braised duck leg), the fish, and the pork belly. The fish was...good-ish. Fairly generous portion of fish, but they were room temperature at best and needed more slaw. The pork belly tacos also lacked slaw and, and while the pork belly was tasty, I wish they had thicker cuts of pork belly, instead of a couple long, thin slices which made the taco feel sparse. The pato, I will say, was a delicious surprise after being underwhelmed by the other 2 tacos. It was moist, flavorful, and had a nice pop of acid from the grilled pineapple. It was also the only taco with a nice amount of slaw which gave some creaminess and crunch.

The tortillas that all the tacos came in seemed to be fresh corn tortillas. And I when I say fresh I mean I think they make them in-house, but they felt old, and they tried to make them crunchy? But instead they were kinda hard around the edges, greasy all around, and just crumbled when you tried to bite the taco. Sad.

This is the kicker. I ordered a side of the Mexican Street Corn. Sounds great, right? It was $4 for a 3 inch piece of corn on the cob that was complete mush. Like they threw a frozen corn on the cob into boiling water, boiled it to hell and back, then threw it on the grill. It tasted of lime, salt, and a bit of chili, but the queso fresco was like it didn't exist. My husband and I laughed at first because it seemed so ridiculous.

And when I asked my husband about his barbacoa tacos, he just said we could find better tacos at any local taqueria here in CA. And the rice was forgettable.

All that to say, you could do better.",mexican

My coworker usually gets the enchiladas suiza and loves them.  I got a chicken quesadilla with tinga (pulled chicken) and it was delicious.  I also got the chips and salsa.  The salsa was a little light, so I ended up pouring the hot sauce into it for some heat and it was perfect.

I tried the vegetarian burrito. The size was pretty big, but probably not enough to have leftovers. My first bite or two were delicious - nice blend of cheese, sour cream, grilled peppers and onions, beans, and rice. However, I quickly realized that the 80% of the burrito filling was just rice.

The rice WAS absolutely amazing - so savory with a strong hint of lime that lightened the flavor. Excellent seasoning. 

They have a good number of vegetarian options and reasonable prices, so I'll be back to try some other items, hopefully with better results.",mexican
1080,3.0,i1QGBziAXxEWlofIe4gv1Q,"Decent tacos, but nothing that exciting.  I had heard some really good things about Bea's, so I was expecting to be more impressed, however the flavors of the tacos just did not come together.  The place has a really authentic feel to it, and my service has been great each time there.  Very friendly and helpful workers.

For food I have now had the chicken taco and the carnitas taco.  The chicken was extremely dry and did not seem very fresh.  The carnitas had a good flavor, but there was not enough of the meat.  Also, the corn shells they use are very flimsy and the tacos do not hold together.

Some of the other menu options did sound really good so I will probably try something other than tacos next time.",mexican

Because we were from out of town and some from out of country, we took a bit long at the counter to order.  But the employee who was working the counter was fantastic in explaining to the guys.  I ordered a burrito and a bottle of water.  I totally forgot to get my water after I ordered and went to our table, but simply had to retrieve it from the fridge.

Found Bea Taco on the internet when I wasn't sure what to do for lunch one day.  The pictures of the food seemed good enough.  Some of the online reviews were good.  I was expecting a decent taco place, but was very surprised with my lunch.

I had the Black and Gold burrito with Chorizo, without beans as I am not a big bean guy.  It was great.  The Chorizo was flavorful, but not overpowering like chorizo can sometimes be.  The entire burrito was smothered, half in mole and the other half in creamy queso cheese.  Delicious!  I got a side of rice as well which was great for helping mop up the remaining mole and queso on my plate.

My wife had a burrito as well with chicken and we shared some chicken taquitos which were very crunchy and great with the guacamole that came on top.

I will say that this place is a little on the pricier side, but well worth it.  Nice staff.  It got packed right after Noon, so be wary of a line when you walk in.  The line stretched from the order counter to the door when we left. But just know that the food here is well worth the wait.",mexican

Now onto the food experience. The restaurant had a very local, personable feel to it. Upon entering my friend and I were greeted by the owner, who introduced himself, and asked for our names.  The other customers seemed to be Southside slopes regulars.

I ordered the sliders and fries, which did not disappoint. Each slider was a 1/4 lb burger, which could hardly be considered a slider. And while I prefer thin crispy fries, the thick cut steak fries were very good.  I will definitely be back now that I know how to tell they are open!",newamerican

...unless they charge your credit card twice for your meal and you pay 40 dollars for a burger. Worse still, that very burger was an inedible 2 pounds of meat, burnt on the outside and raw on the inside, laying inside a tiny bun. Even the pickles from a jar tasted bad. My 10 dollar house red tasted bad. My expectations were low. But if the burger isn't even edible...come on.

Maybe you could come here for a beer? But first just throw a frozen meal in the microwave at home. This was even more disappointing because we have tried to go to UUBU6 half a dozen times, but the hours are inconsistent. We've even shown up 30 minutes before closing time to find the door locked, and the waitress, Diane, just stared at us from down the hallway. 

Persistence did not pay off on this location. If you don't live in the neighborhood, don't even think of making the trip.

*4.5/5*

Talk about food that's both aesthetic and delicious. Acorn, although a $$$ restaurant, has really affordable brunch, normally priced I would say; dinner is when the $$$ comes in. The restaurant itself is fairly large and modern in style with wooden tables and colorful plating. If you're looking for a nice brunch place, or a date spot, this is definitely it. I've been there a few times for brunch and always pleased with the service and food. They have a variety of brunch items, both classic and unique, so those who like to try new things can try new things and those who enjoy the classics and enjoy the classics. 

*BRUNCH*

Beignets - It's so delicate and fluffy and comes with three sauces.

Biscuits & Gravy - one of my favorites. I love the gravy, it was creamy and rich, nicely seasoned. The biscuits were nice and toasty, and balanced really well with the eggs.

Chilaquiles - basically a breakfast nachos. I liked the sauce and the seasoning, with a bit of a kick from the peppers. Personally think there's a bit too much tortilla.

Steak & Eggs - steak is tender and the sauce on the eggs added a good kick to it. The chips however, were not my favorite 


*VERDICT
Of course I'd come back! The food is really good and the presentation even better. I'd love to come for dinner one day.",newamerican
1095,5.0,9MPLntyNzhdUXpGT-h0HUw,"Just wow!

* Food: I came here for my birthday dinner a few weeks ago and I'm glad we picked this place. For appetizers, we got the shrimp toast and mussels (I can't seem to find this on the online menu anymore). I could not decide which one I liked better. The shrimp toast came with chunky scallops and a piece of octopus which tasted so good. The sauce was so savory and tiny bit sweet, I just wanted to take it home! For entrees we got the Linguine and Salmon. The sauce in salmon I ordered was so good I also wanted to take that home. The Linguine was very rich and the portion was generous. They had bits of pistachios in it which was a good touch.   

* Cost vs. Worth: Their dinner prices are the same compared to other restaurants with three money signs. Entrees are around $30 and appetizers are around $15. The food is definitely worth the cost.

 Best. Pancakes. Ever. 
I'm serious, IHOP has nothing on this place. I came here with my boyfriend and his mother for brunch, but we all ordered breakfast. I got 3 chocolate chip short stacked pancakes, with two piece of bacon, German-style home fries, and two scrambled eggs. Best breakfast I've ever had! I ate every single bite of what I ordered. My boyfriend got some corned beef hash, and his mother got 3 original short stacked pancakes, two scrambled eggs and two pieces of bacon on the side. They both loved what they ordered. She said they were the best pancakes she's every had, and my boyfriend agreed, and he didn't even order pancakes. He stole quite a few bites my my pancakes and his mother's, and he regrets not ordering pancakes. He did exclaim that his hash was spectacular however. This might be our new regular spot to come to brunch. For the 3 of us to eat it was only 45$, pretty reasonable in my eyes. I'm not a huge breakfast person, and anytime I go to brunch, I typically order lunch and not breakfast, but this place makes me wanna come back and pig out on some breakfast.

I want to preface this part of the review by saying that when I go out for breakfast, I usually get something salty rather than sweet. However, I can't go to the Original Pancake House and not get pancakes. I'm so glad I went with pancakes because DANG.

I had a really hard time deciding what to get because there are so many appealing options. I opted for the Georgia Pecan Short-stack with a side of breakfast potatoes. My boyfriend got the Apple Cinnamon pancakes with a side of bacon. The bacon was insane. It was so thick and crispy, but still juicy. The Georgia Pecan pancakes were nothing short of perfect - same with the apple cinnamon. The potatoes could've used more seasoning or even onion, but were very good.

1109,3.0,VpsXhgaBA7-65Gt2zg8Nkg,"Quite frankly, I was expecting better from this place. The water was drab at best and strange tasting, weird tap water at worst. They do provide you with a jug of water which allows you to refill your glasses quickly and efficiently, but I propose this question: would you rather have a surplus of bad water or a moderate amount of pristine water? The answer is obvious to me. 

A long time ago, when I was only three, my neighbor Bill opened up a lemonade stand. He was making a lot of money so I, believing lemonade was inferior to water, set up a water stand. I went over to his mom, Mrs. Gates, and asked her if my water was good because I knew my mom would just say yes just to make me feel good. What I did not expect was that Mrs. Gates would say yes just to make me feel good as well. I didn't know she was just trying to be nice at the moment, but when I began to sell, and nobody bought my water, I knew it wasn't good. I was three, and knew very little about making water but it  hurt that I was lied to and I cried for seven weeks. 

The point is, lying to make people feel good never works, which is why I'm going to be very straight forward. This water is worse than the water I made when I was three. I don't know where Bill is (I assume he continued his lemonade salesman career and went bankrupt because lemonade is terrible), but I'm sure he would agree.",newamerican

They had so many good options that it was hard for me to pick one, but I landed on the classic french dip.  The roast beef was actually not well done, but had nice pink in the middle.

We went with the Soup Du Jour which was a butternut squash soup at the time, a Blue Cheese & Pear Salad and a Cranberry Turkey sandwich. The cafe itself is quite dark and mostly the tables are lit. The atmosphere (and also the food) reminded me of an upscale Panera Bread. 

The food was simple, yet well put together. It was what you would expect from a cafe, but a hair fancier than your average cafe. The soup was rich, creamy and even included a garlic toast. The Blue Cheese & Pear Salad was good, but very sweet. Also, they were generous with the blue cheese, which got to be too strong at times. The sandwich tasted fresh and the bread was a bit crunchy on the outside, adding a nice contrast in textures. You really can't go wrong with the combo of turkey and cranberry.

I'm definitely not an ""American food"" restaurant type person (as you can probably see from my reviews lol) but I would go out of my way to get a burger or wrap from this place. 

This time, I got the Rail Trail wrap to-go and it was very good! The buffalo sauce adds a nice kick...I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more if the chicken would've been fried and not grilled. (But maybe they offer that as an option! I didn't ask.) I subbed the fries for onion rings...soooo good. Do yourself a favor and always get the onion rings as your side. Also, the spinach dip (which I failed to snag a photo of because I was too busy eating) is a MUST. The dip has just the right amount of both spinach and artichoke, and it's served with pita bread triangles.

See you next time I visit Pittsburgh, OTB!",newamerican

The only thing that left something to be desired was the poutine, which tries to take a more gourmet approach on a pretty simple dish. Poutine is good as it is, for American poutine it's okay, but it doesn't compare to Canadian poutine!",newamerican
1124,4.0,O40nlfiMpWAKgMx7bH9h6Q,"This place is a solid four stars. They are open late, the food is good, and service is prompt but they don't hover. The Yard is a great date venue but also some where you can go alone, with a group, or with friends to watch the game. 

I ordered the impossible burger-- the toppings were way better than the burger and I think that had something to do with the fact that it wasn't actually a burger. Next time I plan to get a real burger with the same toppings. The caramelized onions, mushrooms and garlic sauce all complemented the ""burger"" very well. 

I think the fries sat out a little too long, they were a tiny bit cold. I didn't fault The Yard for this too much as it was pretty late (after 11pm) and they may have been shorter staffed. 

The atmosphere is very relaxed, you could stay all day and not feel pressured to leave. I really liked this aspect about the Yard. The pricing is on point, food is great especially for late night and menu has something for everyone.",newamerican

The beer selection was pretty good, but lots of what I'd call common beers and lots of non-locals.

The grilled cheese which was supposed to be great was... ok... and way too chewy. I like gooey but not chewy because it's congealed by the time it makes it my way.",newamerican

The veggie pot stickers are green and taste strange. However, it is the closest Chinese restaurant to our house so tonight we ordered take out.

We ordered steamed chicken with veggies, steamed buns which had pork inside and a veggie spring roll. 

Upon returning home, my husband takes a bite of his steamed buns and they are RAW. I don't mean undercooked. Legit raw. How DISGUSTING! I then take a bite of my veggie spring roll and there is shrimp inside. Ew! I do not eat seafood so I was not happy.

At this point we decide to return our food to the restaurant which is super inconvenient considering my husband had to be at work. 

When showing the workers the RAW food and wrong type of egg roll they offered NO apology. They simply offered us a new egg roll. They did take the buns off the bill, but offfered no explanation as to why they were raw.

Mind you this is an expensive Chinese restaurant. So we still ended up paying $20 and were inconvenienced and unhappy.

We get home with my new egg roll. THERE IS SHRIMP IN IT!!!!! So now I'm on my way back AGAIN!

Update: upon going back the manager was extremely nice. He did comp my meal and give me a couple of spring rolls which I greatly appreciate. He is a great guy, and it's unfortunate he had to have the backlash of the kitchens mistakes.",newamerican

Lola is BYOB with a $5 corkage fee (pretty standard). Bring your favorite bottle of wine (or two) and be ready to have your tastebuds delighted by the food. To start, we ordered the Piroshki. The pastry was flaky and light, making a great start to the meal. For an entree, I ordered the Carbonara. The sauce was not overly heavy or rich, which I appreciated.

1138,5.0,blq-6xx8vKcm1Va4LFSORg,"AMAZING 

I can't put into words how good this restaurant is but I'll try. The aesthetic first off is so cute, very low lighting and romantic, and has a small seating area outside that I didn't sit in but looks so nice for enjoying a drink. The food was incredible - a small menu but full of a variety of options for various proteins, fish and vegetarian options. We started with their featured appetizer (they only offer one but switch out that option regularly) which was a beautiful charcuterie board. For dinner I got a creamy scallop pasta, my boyfriend had lamb lollipops and we were DYING at how incredibly delicious they both were. BYOB only which is nice option to keep the check a little lower. The owner was walking around checking on everyone the whole time and our server was also extremely attentive. 

We made another reservation to come back on our way out that night! 10/10 you should go!",newamerican
1139,4.0,blq-6xx8vKcm1Va4LFSORg,"My husband and I had made reservations about 2 months ago to visit here for our anniversary dinner. We made it for 5:30 which is when they open. The tiny restaurant sits on a white stone parking area and off to the one side is an outdoor lounge area with one table set up. I was to learn later that the lounge is for warmer weather and if one group wishes to dine outside.

When they let us in they asked for our wine bottle since I knew ahead of time this place was BYOB. We didn't bring any and just decided to have regular beverages they offered. We were greeted by an outstanding waitress who gave us her fullest attention and made sure all our needs were met. They get their name ""Wild Rosemary"" because they put a sprig of rosemary on every dish that they serve you.

The menu is seasonal and it does state right on it ""no substitutions."" Our waitress offered us a choice of two appetizers one of which was the charcuterie board that goes for $28.00. We decided to pass on that and I'm glad we did because when we saw it at other tables it was huge!

Our dinner started with a roll and vegetable pate spread. I truly loved that spread and could have eaten that whole thing up by itself.  I ordered the lamb shank with roasted vegetables. My husband ordered the scallops with pasta and tomatoes. I inquired about WiFi. They have it. Passcode given upon request. Even with the WiFi reception is terrible 

As we were waiting I noticed they had one way mirrors which gave a darkened effect inside. You cannot see inside but you can see outside. Since the restaurant only accommodates up to about 8 tables it is sometimes difficult to hear because I was in close proximity to the surrounding tables. Everything here is made in house.

With our meal we got an arugula salad to share known as ""wilted rocket."" It is served with tomatoes and sliced cucumbers but when we shared it I found it over-drenched with balsamic vinaigrette. They were kind enough to make another for us. That one was better however, it had only one small tomato and one slice of cucumber in it. Needless to say that was the least favorite of the meal.

Our entrees were presented very nicely. My lamb shank literally ""fell off the bone"" in some places. Those pieces were soft and tender. Other parts of it was a bit hard to cut because I had to try my best to cut away the fat from the skin. That part tasted a little dry however, it sat in a very tasty brown gravy which added to the flavor. My husband only got 3 scallops with his tomatoes and pasta and seemed to enjoy it. Needless to say both meals were quite filling.

We decided to go for dessert because we were celebrating. I ordered a mixed berry pie like dessert while my husband had coconut cheesecake. The presentation was so touching when they brought out the desserts with two long red candles in honor of our special day. I was grateful that I ordered the berry pie. It was filling but not overwhelming. My husband's cheesecake was very good but extremely filling.

When we got our check I noticed that they put on 20% house charge. This is the tip built into your check. The chef came out to congratulate us as well as our waitress and a couple of the staff members.

For fine dining this place is extremely casual so you don't need to dress us. It is best to make your reservations when they open because parking can become problematic later since it is a tiny place. They are located on the lower part of Bower Hill Road in Upper St Clair as you approach Bridgeville.",newamerican

1141,3.0,blq-6xx8vKcm1Va4LFSORg,"Came here for dinner on a Thursday night. We had made the reservation several months in advance as the seating is very limited. I was very eager to try this place as I have heard so many good things and it is close to home! As there are not a lot of tables, we had to wait probably a half hour for our table as the people had not left yet and were taking their time with dessert. 

Once we finally got seated, I was disappointed that their only appetizer was the charcuterie board. As my friend did not eat pork or beef, we did not get it. I wanted to try the scallops, but was disappointed once again that they were out of the scallops. As there are only 10 or so items on the menu to be out of several dishes was not ideal. I ended up getting the lamb lollies. I had ordered medium well, but they came out medium rare. I was getting pretty frustrated by this point as we were starving. Once the lamb came back, the waiter told us the dinner was on the house. This was nice as our experience really had not been great. The lamb was cooked well and had a nice flavor. 

For dessert, we had the creme brûlée cheesecake and chocolate caramel tart. The cheesecake was delicious with a nice creamy inside and sugary top. Overall, our experience was fine, but I was not blown away. I would recommend not having a later reservation as ours was for 8:30 and they were out of multiple dishes and we had to wait quite a bit for our table.",newamerican
1142,4.0,blq-6xx8vKcm1Va4LFSORg,"This place was small, dark, and had a private party type of feel. The food was pretty dang good. Although one major drawback was (like other reviewers mentioned) the acoustics. This could be improved with sound absorbers in the ceiling and/or on the walls. Some can even blend in as paintings.

My grandfather is hard of hearing. He really doesn't enjoy loud places. He can't really contribute to conversation so he ends up just being grumpy.

1144,3.0,T45qonnG40PTVex3Ua2Q9w,"Having gone to the Porch a couple of times now, I have absolutely no complaints about their food. I love going here for brunch - their prices are very reasonable and come hungry because they give you huge portions! The space is very airy and bright, although there were a couple of flies hanging around just because the porch section is open, but it's not a deal breaker.

We arrived a little after 10:30am and the porch area was a little packed, but inside seating was pretty empty. They don't sit everyone on top of each other when it's unnecessary too which I appreciated lol. Our waitress was extremely friendly and patient.

We wanted to try a handful of brunch food since I was thinking about having my bridal shower here. However, what really aggravated me was when she went to get the manager to speak to us about private events, he wouldn't come out because he was too busy and to call back tomorrow or another time. In my opinion, this didn't leave a very good impression and we only needed a couple minutes of his time. Again, they weren't very busy at the time so I don't see why he wouldn't want to speak to someone interested in a private event, which made my decision a little easier.

On another note, the food is extremely fresh and hot and tastes like it came out of your mother's kitchen! I will definitely be returning, just not having any private events there.",newamerican

We went in there (it was pretty empty) and were waiting for our friends at the bar area so we could start drinking together. The bartender approached us and threatened that she would kick us out unless we ordered a drink. This was our initial interaction with her, not something along the lines of, ""what can I get you guys"". Not wanting to respond to her negativity, my friend was like,  ""hmm sure I'll get a cranberry vodka,"" which was $3.50 I believe. As he took $3 out of his wallet, she literally says, ""YOU BETTER HAVE THAT F*CKING 50 cents"". She was extremely rude and despite everything my friend still tried talking to her before we left as that is not the way to speak to a customer. Her only response was, ""So what, I don't f*cking care"".

The menu is pretty decent for bar food - the pierogis are tasty and I also like the regular old hamburger. The loaded fries are pretty good too, and the prices are fair. Definitely not overpriced like some of the newer places.

We were excited to try here.  Love the idea of adding more family owned businesses to any Pitt siege neighborhood.  Unfortunately, Revival became increasingly saddening as the night went on.

Pros: our waitress was lovely and really tried.  The gentleman checking on tables (owner maybe?) was sweet and genuine.  However... it didn't make up for the food and corresponding price.

We started off with a very delayed soup special... chicken pot pie soup.  If we were at Cracker Barrel.. good. However for a $10 special, I wanted anything unique.  Had to ask for salt and a lot of pepper to make it better.

For entrees, we went with the short rib and the bucatini pasta.  The short rib was somehow dry, how is that possible.  The pasta was boring and so bland.  No amount of pepper gave it the flavor a $32 pasta deserved.  Additionally, the chicken was dry.

After we lingered to finish our bottle of wine, he still didn't return with our bill. Finally, another server stopped at our table and said she would bring us our bill; she did, although it was a good five minutes later.

We tried to get a reservation for 3 and were unable to do so. We made a reservation for 2 instead and were seated at a table for 4. We told the restaurant about it and sadly it sounds like this is not uncommon for OpenTable reservations.

The food was delicious even though they only had the selections for restaurant week, so options were limited. Sadly, they were unwilling to make ANY substitutions during restaurant week, so if you have allergies you may want to avoid restaurant week.

Another warning to those with allergies... Items on the menu for restaurant week often did NOT mention all the ingredients (i.e. both desserts included chocolate, but only one of the desserts mentioned chocolate). When we return, I'm going to be sure to ask about all ingredients, since coffee is sometimes used in cooking AND in desserts and they may hide it somewhere without my knowledge.

If I'm being really honest, I was having a hard time finding something on the menu that really spoke to me. Then like music to my ears, the waiter read the specials and he said short rib. The short rib did not disappoint. It was so tender, juicy and delicious. The only thing on the plate that I didn't really like that much was the mashed potatoes. They were whipped and not mashed. 

My husband had the pork chops and he said they were just ok. He was really hoping for more. It's a shame because he was really looking forward to eating them.

What's Hot
- Layout.  It's more upscale than I anticipated, but it's very nice.  There are tables and booths and everything is evenly spaced out, which is not crowded.  It's not very bright inside with fluorescent lighting, which I appreciate.  More importantly, this place isn't loud and doesn't play loud music.  The ambiance is more intimate.
- Quality of food.  The seafood cobb salad came with lump blue crab meat, 2 large shrimp, small scallops, chopped up boiled egg, half an avocado, bacon pieces, and grape tomatoes.  The salad dressing didn't overpower the flavor of the seafood and salad.  Good amount of all ingredients, although I would have liked more shrimp.  Haha...  At least they were the jumbo shrimp.  The seafood was natural and flavorful, not overpowering and didn't have a bad seafood smell.  My friend has dietary allergies, so she requested specific ingredients be taken out and/or swapped out for her dishes.  They obliged and my friend enjoyed her food, as well. 
- Menu variety.  It looks like there is something for everyone, which is nice.  Not a large menu and not overwhelming.
- Service.  Pretty good.  I arrived before my friend and the hostess seated me first.  She also took down my friend's name so they could keep us together when my friend arrived, which I definitely appreciated.  The hostess also accommodated my request for a booth.  They catered to my friend's dietary needs, which was good.  If you have leftovers, they'll put in a take away container without you having to ask which is also helpful.
- Portions.  Decent size portions, but don't expect to be full on one dish.
- Price.  Pretty reasonable, given the quality and portions.  

What's Not
- Service.  No bread served before the meal.  To be fair, I'm not certain if the restaurant generally doesn't serve bread of maybe they don't serve bread during lunch.  After we paid, my friend and I stuck around a bit and chatted.  However, the wait staff left us alone after we paid.  No one came to refill our glasses of water and check in on us.  I've been to restaurants where the wait staff will check in on you after paying the tab and at least refill water glasses.  To me, that's the mark of excellent service.  I appreciate it more when service continues after the financial incentive may be over.  After all, isn't it possible we could change our mind and still order?  Different strokes for different folks, but that's me.
- Price.  There are definitely pricey items on the menu, especially when it comes to steak and seafood.  The portions aren't huge, just moderate.  This restaurant seems to be a place you go to for special occasions and not so much for a ""just because"" reason.

I have been here twice in the past month and loved the experience both times! Yesterday we stopped in for Mother's Day Brunch and got lucky with a table reservation that had canceled just as we got there. They kindly filled us in that spot, as they had previously been booked for the entire day. So glad we decided to chance it! We had a fabulous meal here! We started with $5 mimosas and pot roast nachos. The nachos were incredible! The flavors were on point! I had the crab and avocado omelet with breakfast potatoes, family had the chicken and waffles, ham and cheese omelet, and chicken salad with goat cheese and all kinds of goodness. Everyone loved their food! One thing I really appreciate is that their breakfast items are not greasy. The potatoes and omelets leave no grease behind on the plate and have a really clean flavor! Most breakfasts I order out just seem plain unhealthy in comparison to what we got at Ditkas! 
My family wanted to try some deserts so we got the coconut cream pie and banana cream pie. Both made in-house.. both exceptionally go

The atmosphere is very classy but not stuffy. All of the servers are kind and top notch customer service from everyone in the house. I'm happy to know of another breakfast/brunch spot in the Robinson area!!",newamerican

1166,5.0,UCJpL9VFk3g1B2gjRlLy_g,"My family and I were pleasantly surprised at how great our brunch experience was a few days ago. We decided to take a chance to see if they had any availability on Mother's Day. Luckily, a reservation was cancelled and we were able to get a table right away! 

All of our food was delicious. We ordered the pot roast nachos as an appetizer. That's not usually my thing, but they were pretty good. I ordered the ham and cheese omelet, which was a nicely portioned, standard omelet with breakfast potatoes. Mimosas were only $5 at brunch, and they were tasty too! My mom ordered the Mike's chicken salad (goat cheese, candied pecans, apples, etc), and I wish I would have ordered that instead. My brother ordered the chicken and waffles, and they made that dish really well in comparison to some other breakfast places in the area. Lastly, we ordered two pieces of pie for dessert; one was coconut cream, and the other was banana cream pie. All of the desserts are homemade in-house, but I highly recommend the banana cream pie.",newamerican
1167,4.0,UCJpL9VFk3g1B2gjRlLy_g,"Took my husband and family here for Father's day brunch. Reservations are a must when you have a holiday so I had made one through Open Table.

They had a good selection of breakfast items but since it was mid afternoon we all went with the lunch since of the brunch menu. I had the salmon with red quinoa and broccolini, my husband had a single crabcake with brown rice and coleslaw, my daughter had a burger with fries, and my son settled for a plate of mixed vegetables.

Ditka's is primarily a steak place so they don't accommodate vegan too well. The vegetables on the menu are sauteed in a garlic sauce but the staff was willing to accommodate my son but serving them freshly cooked. They do have a vegetarian option which is a cooked pasta. I did not get to inquire about gluten free.

Our waitress was very accommodating and attentive to our needs. My salmon seemed a little dry but the touch of lemon on the side perked it up a bit. I truly enjoyed the red quinoa with those added pineapples. It added a ""pop"" of flavor to it. I also found the broccolini very tasty. My husband enjoyed his crab cake meal. What really looked delicious was my daughter's burger. That I could have really gone to town on. The portion was huge so she asked for a take out container. They combined about 4 vegetables for my son and I got to sample his Brussel Sprouts as well as an asparagus, and a red pepper. All were cooked nicely but since it was  prepared plain they tasted the same way you would if you steamed fresh vegetables you would purchase at the grocery store. Nevertheless, I was pleased with my sampling his meal and found them enjoyable. He too was unable to finish it all so he took the rest of it home. 

Everyone seemed pleased with their meals and it makes a great place to go for a holiday or special occasion. The place does get crowded during those time frames but they have plenty of parking in their own private lot.

1168,5.0,uBroDHaLcXSE24c8EhPvmw,"We went here on a Wednesday with a reservation and it was super busy. With that said, you definitely need a reservation. You may also want to take into account that even with a reservation they might not be ready for you to order until 5-10 minutes after your reservation. It is not hard to see why they are such a popular place to be however and I definitely recommend going here if you are looking for a creative combination of healthy and high quality ingredients.

The ""gathering board charcuterie"" had an interesting assortment of crispy pickled vegetables, a touch of preserved meat, local honey (with the honey comb and all), olives,  three  different cheeses (cheddar cheese, mustard cheese and blue cheese) and just two brick oven baked crackers which I kind of wish they had more of.

My absolute favorite was the special, which included sea scallops with yellow tomato gazpacho, apple and kohlrabi salad, pickled shallots and lemon oil. The scallops were huge and cooked to perfection and the other ingredients were super light and refreshing. You felt healthy after eating it and it was something I never would have thought to make at home.

I also really enjoyed the vegetarian option, which included brown rice fritters with roasted vegetable black bean hash and horseradish cream. Super yummy and healthy at the same time. The fritters were nice and crispy without being too oily and the generous serving of vegetables were also very flavorful.

None of the food was too heavy. Even the shrimp corn dogs and tiramisu were light and fluffy.

Although the prices were good for the quality of the food I do wish the serving sizes could have been a bit bigger... I definitely would not have felt full without also ordering an appetizer and dessert.",newamerican

They offered a very small lunch menu. I had a burger as did one of my companions and the other chose the chicken sandwich. I had a side salad with mine and my friends both chose fries. The portions were extremely small but we enjoyed our meals. I would say the burger was 3-4 ounces and the salad was only a small handful of spring mix with a few golden raisins and very few vegetables. I found it strange that the didn't offer ranch dressing and only had three dressings to choose from. (A Caesar, a citrus and a wine vinaigrette) it was definitely what I would consider a light lunch.",newamerican

1176,3.0,_P_Hznxd1vF-agFXTS8KGw,"I remember this restaurant as being really good. At least I think this is the same restaurant. The experience this most recent time was not good, both food and service, so I'm doubting if this is even the same restaurant I remember.

We sat in the bar and the bartender said she would send out a server. Another party entered and sat too and a gentleman server went over to serve them. He seemed really nice. We figured he would come over to our table next but he didn't. Then a lady came over to our table, pen and paper in hand without saying a word. We assumed that was our invitation to order. We didn't know if she wanted just a drink order because she never said a word. We started with drinks and when she returned we ordered our entrees. Her name was Karan. I don't know if that is pronounced like Karen because she never told us. I found it on the receipt.

Service was just okay. We watched the other table get served by the gentleman, talking and explaining the menu, and thought we chose the wrong table. Our server spent a good deal of time talking to that table and even sat down with them for quite a while. She must have known them. Maybe that's why they received good service, but the male server seemed genuinely nice.

Food was also just okay. I remember the food being really good. It felt like we were eating cafeteria food. The salad was not fresh. The entrees were alright, nothing bad, but not great either. Prices weren't that high so we weren't that concerned. We wanted to order another round of drinks but our server was so unfriendly that we figured it wasn't worth the hassle.

I'm not sure if it was bad timing or an off day. I would try eating here again with another server. I would definitely give the food another chance.",newamerican

1179,5.0,gs4NP7lZ-71AFTFQ-5Thhg,"Had a great date night dinner with my fiancé on a Saturday night at their casual downstairs restaurant (their upstairs restaurant is the more fancy one). They don't take reservations but we had no wait for a table of two around 6:30pm. The place has an upbeat feel with music playing and a younger crowd, but not rowdy like lots of Carson Street places.

The food is definitely on the heavier side but YUM! We started off with the brussels sprouts appetizer, which was great. The sprouts were pan fried with a bit of a crisp and the dish had heavily smoked, sliced grapes which made for a very unique flavor combination. We also got the cauliflower mac and cheese (it seems like their mac and cheese is a specialty). Wow! The entire dish came in a cast iron skillet, with crispy cauliflower on top and soft mac below. Heavy, yes, but quite delicious. Finally we got the Nashville chicken sandwich. Our waitress split the sandwich and side potatoes on two plates which was so nice. The sandwich was just fine, basically buffalo chicken flavored chicken breast on a plain bun. We've been to Nashville and had hot chicken though, and this sandwich did not measure up to its name. Oh well.

All in all a great meal though. We got a class of red wine and those three dishes all for $50 with tax, which I'd say is good value.",newamerican
1180,2.0,gs4NP7lZ-71AFTFQ-5Thhg,"It's such a bummer to give a negative review for this place, because the chef/owner is well-respected in the Pgh food community, but service is EVERYTHING. We've tried Bonfire twice now, with poor service both times.

The first time, we went for dinner and were seated at a high-top near the bar. There were two other tables occupied. The person who seated us got us water, and then we sat and waited. And waited. We sat there for more than 20 MINUTES, trying to be patient because it was a new restaurant. No staff passed by our table, and the bartender right next to us was engaged in a lengthy conversation with two bar patrons. We thought he would look over and notice us when they finally left, but he just proceeded to clean up behind the bar for another five minutes. With low expectations set at that point, we decided to get up and leave. The bartender saw us get up, rushed over, and claimed he was actually our waiter for the night! He offered to get us some drinks ""really fast"" if we would stay, but I just said, ""Um, this is awkward, we're going to go."" Maybe if he had offered free drinks or something, we would have considered it, but getting something for us ""really fast"" didn't seem to be in their wheelhouse that night.

Then this weekend, after giving it a few months, we decided to try brunch. We made a reservation, which apparently means nothing. I mentioned it to the person who sat us, and she just shrugged and pointed us to a table near the door. She didn't even greet us; she was grabbing cleaning supplies from the stand as we walked in and just muttered that she had to clean some tables first. There was a group of 5 that came in later, was told there would be a 20-30 minute wait, mentioned their reservation, and was still told, ""Yeah, the wait is still the same."" Never saw anyone look at any reservation list of any sort.

My husband ordered coffee and I ordered a cocktail, the Connie Collins. It tasted like watered down lemon juice and the cup was 3/4 ice. I saw another patron walk toward the Bloody Mary bar, having been given a cup filled to the brim with ice. Where is the actual drink supposed to go?  I had to wave our waitress down after 15 minutes to order another drink, and my husband's coffee, far empty at that point, wasn't refilled until another waiter passed by with the coffee pot as we were eating our entrees. Other little things, like my husband asking for no potatoes and still receiving them on his plate, and us asking for a cup of ice for our daughter's water and never seeing it, also reflected poor service training. A different waiter cleared our plates and brought our bill at the end; our waitress showed her face to thank as quickly as we were signing the bill and filling in the tip. ::eyeroll:: 

The food was decent, but nothing to write home about. We ordered the shishitos to start; the hollandaise was a nice addition to cut the heat, but they needed salt. My lamb benedict, with sweet onions and hollandaise, also needed salt. If you're not going to put salt and pepper on the table, you better be sure you've properly seasoned the food. The breakfast potatoes on the side were the best part of the meal, but who goes to a restaurant because of the breakfast potatoes? Everyone serves those, and it's pretty hard to screw up. My husband had steak and eggs; the steak was cooked nicely, but again, you can get good food AND good service at sooo many other places in the city.",newamerican

We split the pesto, pear, Gorgonzola, and onion jam flat bread (what a fantastic mix of savory and sweet flavors), the chicken meat balls mixed with arugula pesto and crispy Asiago (these were fantastic, and generous portion of 5 medium sized meatballs), crispy Brussels sprouts (the grapes were a lovely touch), and the fiber BBQ pork lettuce wraps (super filling and succulent!).

1182,3.0,gs4NP7lZ-71AFTFQ-5Thhg,"Beautiful atmosphere, menu looks great, but I left disappointed. We had a larger group, ordered several appetizers, each our own entree and then shared several desserts. Everyone seemed to like their food a lot, my partner ate his macaroni bowl in minutes. However, I really disliked the appetizer and entree I ordered. The appetizer was a very bitter brussel sprout dish. I took one bite and could not take another. It was awful. My entree was a pizza in which I had taken the meat off of, and the sauce was awful. I couldn't eat that either. Again with the extremely bitter taste. The sauce was smoked which sounds amazing but I will never be able to eat smoked sauce again. Very, very bad!

The ONLY THING saving this restaurant experience for me were the absolutely heavenly desserts. Every dessert was incredible, delicious. I especially loved the deconstructed s'mores dessert. Divine! Our waiter was also very pleasant. 

The others enjoyed it, or were too polite to tell me that hadn't. Perhaps it was just me or just what I had ordered, but I don't think I'd come here again for dinner. (Maybe desserts and drinks)",newamerican

Unfortunately it  fell very short.  The atmosphere is lovely, but that is where the good stops and mediocre begins.

Knowing ahead of time that there would be a select holiday menu, we went with the expectation that the dinners chosen would highlight the restaurants bests.  Two of us had the scallops, which were excellent as you can read in other reviews.  One of us had the lemon chicken which was good.  Another had the duck which she said was just ordinary.  The sides (risotto and asparagus) were better than the duck.  The remaining two of us has the rib-eye steak.  It was a horrible cut of meat.  Very grisly.  Not marbled like  it should have been.  We left over half of it on the plate.  When asked by the waitress how the meals were, we told her about the steak and she did nothing.  Said nothing.  Didn't apologize,  Didn't offer to get something else.  Nothing.  Since we had to pay for it, we wrapped it and took it home for our dog.  He enjoyed our $40 steak dinner better than we did.

Service itself was slow, which you sometimes see on a holiday, but you would think they would have staffed appropriately.

The best thing about this place is the cozy atmosphere with a real fireplace.  The calamari appetizer was good.  But the seafood lasagna special had no taste even though it looked good.  My husband had the veal wrapped in prosuitto.  It was supposed to be in small thin slices but came out like a steak.  Wasn't tender, hard to cut, could see veins in it, and seemed like some or most was still raw.  My husband kept spitting it out.  Told the server and he then ordered shrimp which he said was ok.  
Milky Way martini was good.

My entree was chicken dipped in egg and served in a lemon sauce with artichoke hearts - it was ok.  Hubby always orders lamb chops and wasn't too impressed with these.

The bruschetta appetizer was forgettable. The wilted greens on top were pretty gross. I had a slug in my salad (hey, lettuce grows outside - it happens - I didn't make a peep about it but the server also never asked, so, there's that) My husbands portobello penne looked like noodles in dirty dish water. He said it tasted about the same. My chicken risotto came without chicken and had less than one piece of asparagus cut up in it. That said, risotto is supposed to be creamy due to the way the starch is cooked. This was just swimming in cream to the point of being soupy. Our server was abysmal. Pass.",newamerican

I took my mother here for her 80th birthday, and we were both very disappointed with the restaurant. If you are planning to try this place, MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO GO ELSEWHERE! For our entrees, my mother ordered the chicken risotto, and I ordered the pasta primavera. The entrees arrived way to soon, about 5 minutes after our salads were served. Every fine dining restaurant knows to allow enough time between the salad and entrée. No one wants to eat their salad, while their entrée is getting cold. Then, the chef, who only had one other customer besides us, screwed up both meals! He made my mother's chicken risotto without chicken (when it doesn't even come that way), and he added chicken to my (vegetarian) pasta primavera. It was obvious that the chef was very inexperienced and had no idea what he was doing! My pasta primavera was swimming in olive oil, and my mother's risotto was extremely watery. All SEASONED chefs understand that risotto should be cooked until all the liquid is absorbed! Also, everyone knows, that when you screw up two meals at a fine dining restaurant, you offer the guests either free dessert, a free appetizer, or you comp their meals. We were offered no compensation what-so-ever for the chefs mistake! It was clear to me that the employees at Slate Bistro have no idea how to properly handle problems at their restaurant. We were also very disappointed with the dessert selections. They did not have any of the traditional fine dining desserts you would expect such as tiramisu, crème brulee, and cheesecake. Instead they served all ice cream desserts that you would find at a pizza or burger joint. Who wants grilled banana bread and a scoop of ice cream for dessert at a fine dining restaurant? I have never seen a restaurant so empty for dinner! Do yourself a favor and pick somewhere else to go!",newamerican

1207,5.0,6V8D6uCQ-ChFap59Fc-ZoA,"We ate here yesterday not really knowing what to expect. It is a lot larger than I expected it to be. It is a sports bar so a lot of tvs were playing various sports and it was a little dark. We decided to split 12 wings and a buffalo chicken sandwich. We were most definitely both pleasantly surprised!

The wings:
AMAZING. I had the jalapeño honey and you could tell it was a homemade sauce. The wings were crisp but not overdone. Plenty of sauce but not drowning. My bf got the buffalo ranch and he preferred those to my flavor but, like myself, really liked them both. The buffalo ranch is a pretty basic sauce but it was great, too!

The sandwich: 
The waitress asked if we were splitting it and offered to bring it out on two plates. We said it wasn't necessary but she did it for us. The sandwich wasn't too spicy (I like hot things, so maybe to others it would be?) and was cooked perfectly. It was served on brioche so we both were SOLD. It was reallyyy good. 

The fries:
The sandwich came with fries. We subbed the regular fries (there were multiple options such as garlic, oil bay, etc.) for sweet potato waffle fries. They were awesome. Came with a sweet butter side which was good (think Texas Roadhouse butter) but we just used ranch and ketchup.

All around really good food. They have specials every day and we'll definitely be back to try more, especially since it's right by our house. Every burger and plate that came past our table looked awesome and prices are very fair. The waitress (I don't know if she ever said her name) was so nice and polite. She went above and beyond for us!

The dish was so cheesy that I couldn't taste the bacon or even the jalapeno that were mixed in, also the fries got soggy very quickly. As a positive, the dish was quite large so it's great for sharing and is reasonably priced.

I was a little disappointed that they did not have pizza on the menu at the Airport location.

Either way, made the best of it and decided to go with the Rueben, stacked tall along with a giant pickle and a Coke to wash it all down.  I have to say it hit the spot, even though I was craving pizza.

The Rueben is Pastrami and corned beef I believe, with Swiss cheese, hot slaw and fries on top of it all.  An entire meal in a bun, perfect.  Added the pickle to round it out.

1224,4.0,1RECFIhw6tdiP4l3smu6Kw,"In general, I think I make poor decisions. I know that's a pessimist point of view, but honestly. In life, I make some dumbass decisions. I definitely think that holds true for whenever I dine at the Yard. Every time I've eaten here, I've had a decent meal; however my dining companion ALWAYS orders something better. EVERY. DAMN. TIME.

My most recent trip to the Yard came after a Pens game when my friend wanted some late night food. I knew exactly where I was going to take him. The Yard is located in the northwest corridor of the Market area on the second floor of its building. It is a lot bigger than anyone would ever expect so large groups are definitely welcomed here - the place has a vertical setting, with the bar section near the stairs and entrance, and regular seating, restrooms, and the kitchen to the back.

Being the beer loving individual that I am, the Yard speaks to me. There's always a large amount of beers on tap to choose from, including some Cincinnati treasures. They had one of my top three beers on tap the last visit - Southern Tier's Choklat Stout! 

My friend was starving and ordered Mac and cheese bites before our meals. It was an excellent decision - this was quite possibly some of the best Mac and cheese balls I've had. I'm not usually a fan of them because I find the texture overwhelming, but the macaroni was perfectly cooked and it was gooey. It hit the spot! Plus, it came with chipotle ranch, which is always an A+ in my book because marinara sauce is gross.

I decided on the Impossible Burger grilled cheese. They're known for their outrageous grilled cheese concoctions, which all really border on regular sandwich combinations. The 10% choklat must have really hit me or I wanted to do Burger King one better, because as soon as I read ""Impossible"", I was sold without reading any of the toppings. The burger/grilled cheese came with a large amount of goat cheese. I like goat cheese in moderation. The rest of the sandwich was delicious, but a massive letdown all because I can't read. As stated at the beginning, my dining companion always orders something better. The last time I was here I ordered the pierogi sandwich and desperately wanted my dad's sandwich instead. The same thing happened to me this time - I had sandwich envy from my friend's pulled pork grilled cheese. That's not anyone's fault but my own. I was at least able to enjoy the perfect crisp waffle fries with some ranch!

I will continue to visit the Yard whenever in Pittsburgh. It's one of my favorite spots in the city, and it's popular enough to have multiple offshoots around the 'Burgh. Someday I'll even figure out a favorite menu item so I can fully enjoy my time and food!",newamerican

I'm in my twenties myself, but they were so unprofessional. The gentleman who served me didn't know anything about the menu. It seemed like they didn't have a dress code and I found that they were on their phones or meandering and sitting at the tables for most of the time I was there. 

There were two women were great and seemed to be calling he shots. But truly, that's all you needed. Why do you need so many bodies behind the counter?

For some reason they decided that they needed to distribute the 3 people before me and after me all at the same time. Instead of as they were done. So strange. 

Also a car alarm went off outside for a couple minutes and it seemed like the world was ending for the staff. ""Omg does someone not care at all about their car"" and ""wow this is SO annoying"" was all I heard. They were more whiny and annoying than the car themselves!

WHO DOESN'T LIKE A GOOD MEATBALL?

Honestly. Wanted to try it and glad it was proposed. Nice place that has three different types of places in it on different levels. Made a reservation via yelp and walked in. 

I went with the 4 meatball option with a side - the traditional beef meatball, marinara sauce, and the crispy brussel sprouts. As well as a Diet Pepsi. 

The meatballs were good - would have liked to have more sauce- but good. The crispy brussel sprouts were good to me.

I came with coworkers for happy hour yesterday and at first we were going to sit at 2 separate tables but then half of us just decided to stand at the bar. So I'll give you the run down at the bar and at the table: 

Bar: this isn't Southside on a Friday night, it shouldn't take me more than 10 minutes to get a glass of wine. The issue isn't necessarily the bartenders (even though they definitely were socializing a lot considering how many people needed drinks) it's the fact that they're SEVERELY understaffed behind the bar. The picture I took shows half the bar and look at the drinks. Every single person has an empty glass. Isn't that the number one responsibility at a bar? 

Table: the waiter was beyond confused the entire time. He would come back and say something wasn't available or it was kicked or offer a drink for free then at the end he charged everyone for everything and was like oh I forgot. Getting checks was a literal nightmare also. Considering this is in the Casino and I'd imagine the goal to be pump people in and out so they can gamble, they definitely fail at that.

The bites came out first and were pretty good but not great.  The jalapinos were rather small but for bacon lovers- the bacon was abundant!

The nachos was a mountain that had everything you would want on nachos.  Perfect...!

My Fish & Chips ($17) came out good but not great.  The fish was a bit greasy as if the oil wasn't hot enough.  The chips were a mix of fries & waffle cuts and were very good.  The mixed veggies (cauliflower, broccoli & carrots) were perfect.  

The others in my party ordered sandwiches.  They came w your choice of veggies, fries or Cole slaw.

My wife ordered the Ultimate Burger ($10) med well and it came out perfect.  She loved it and the bite she gave me was delicious.  She said the fries were good but not great.

My mom ordered the Hot Pastrami ($10) and she loved it.  She had the Cole slaw and once she took the small bowl off her plate- her sandwich looked naked.

My dad ordered the fish sandwich ($12) and although he said it was good- I don't think he was very happy with it.  His fries didn't leave the plate. 

All in all, we were pleased w our meals and service was excellent...",newamerican

The food is decent and the hostesses are always nice/personable, but multiple different servers are just not that great.

Overall, the food is perfectly balanced.  You will find a pleasant mix of flavors that will delight your palate in every. single. dish.  We started off with with Shishito peppers.  I was starving (on light up night) and quickly grabbed a pepper off the plate without really looking or paying attention.  I took a bite and thought 'hmmm needs salt, or lemon, or something, but not bad'.  I then grabbed another pepper and realized what I thought was color in the design of the plate was a sauce.  My second bite was reward with a sauce exploding with complimentary flavors including chile and acid.  So yummy.  That however was not even the star of the appetizers.  We also got the Sunday gravy, a mix of lamb, sauce, and ricotta, with bread to scoop it up.  The savory sauce which tastes like it has been braised for days balanced perfectly with the creamy ricotta and crusty bread.  PHENOMINAL.  It tasted almost like a dream of my grandmothers kitchen when I was 5 (though I am sure my grandmother never cooked as well as that).

My partner and I both got the steaks.  Deliciously cooked with crispy potatoes and savory mushrooms.  I could have gotten down with a few more potatoes on my plate... but is that surprising for a Pittsburgh (insert shrug emoji)?  We finished with the mac and cheese (because mac and cheese is a dessert right?).  It was creamy and complex.  A delicious mix of different cheeses without cheddar overpowering the others. 

Cocktails were good.  I love the whiskey punch specials can't beat the taste and price.  Ambiance is stellar.  Service above par.  

Much love for this place.  Highest compliments.  Perhaps worth a standing reservation.",newamerican

Ambiance - cool vibe upstairs and downstairs. Dimly lit and somehow lively and intimate at the same time. Was packed for a weekday (Tues) but we were able to get a table without a reservation. 

Service - attentive. Friendky

Drinks - seasonal cocktails. Had an excellent version of their old fashioned and I'd recommend it. 


Food - we split 4 apps/small plates which was perfect. My favorite was the dirty pasta- it's their most popular dish for a reason. Carrots were just okay which was disappointing

Price - we got 4 drinks and 4 small plates for $100. Left slightly buzzed and full.

My last month in Pittsburgh a friend and I did dinner here.  It was a beautiful day so we sat outside.  I ordered the steak and Mac and cheese.  Both dishes were fantastic!

I got the tasting menu and added the wine pairings and it was amazing!

This place is a little pricey but so awesome for special occasions - a little tip - if you sign up at bigburrito.com you'll get a postcard to get a free dinner entrée on your birthday week to use at any of the big burrito restaurants - this one is worth it!

They have a huge wine list to choose from and they print their dinner menu daily with special seasonal dishes.  Hubby always gets the lamb chops or lamb loins (both he loves) and I like to try different dishes when I go.  This time they had a seafood sampler which included a crab cake, scallop and fish all with white grits and some veggies- very good but I probably wouldn't get again.

The inside of the restaurant is beautiful, and the highlight was the service, which was excellent - friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.  Our dishes were very good, if not amazing.  I started with a beet salad, which had a few nice touches but a 
bit small and did not entirely live up to its potential.  Dates were a lovely addition; in contrast, the advertised ""citrus tofu"" was in the form of unrecognizable flakes (or missing?).  

For an entree I had the linguine with lump crab.  It was very satisfying - good and buttery...although, getting past the lemon juice drizzled on top, a bit bland.  However, my wife's Scottish Salmon dish was really amazing and bursting with flavors.  Guess I might be more enthusiastic if I had ordered her meal!  I also had a great martini.

The BLUE BAY MUSSELS, made with shallots, garlic confit, fennel seed, herbs, sherry, croutons and salami, is a heaping, steaming dish good enough for two people to share. And it's so good.

The PROSCIUTTO TOAST is actually four grilled sourdough toasts topped with smoked ricotta, rhubarb jam and slices of blood orange. These were absolutely amazing.

Anyways, for food we ordered the smoked salmon app, the linguini, and the fried chicken & biscuits.  The presentation of the smoked salmon app classed-up what is essentially a deconstructed lox bagel, but the taste is otherwise standard.  My gf's linguini with citrus butter, garlic, zucchini, spinach, and crab really just tasted like lemon juice.  Probably avoid that option.  The fried chicken and biscuits was rich and savory.  Absolutely filling, so do not consume if the 'Lers or Pens are playing within the next couple hours.",newamerican
1252,5.0,woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ,"Tako has very quickly become our favorite taco spot. Although the tacos aren't the most traditional, the flavors are fantastic, and the drink menu is a wonderful place to explore.

My favorite tacos are definitely the chorizo tacos. Delicious chorizo, caramelized onion, AND a fried egg? What's not to love about this taco? I'd say the greatest downside is that they serve their tacos on wooden boards, but I always keep the plate given with the appetizers (the guacamole is super solid) and use some leftover chips to catch the taco filling that drops out as you're eating.

The other tacos that I've tried are all unique and excellent in their own ways. The octopus--the main attraction for some--is incredibly tender and unlike any other octopus I've had.

The drink menu is diverse and ever-changing. My favorite is the Cardboard Helicopter, but I've also had It's a Vibe multiple times. I always take a picture of the menu when I go, because you never know when they may rotate out some drinks and try some new seasonal flair.

Overall, Tako is not your traditional taco shop, but it excels in all the right ways and never disappoints.

Be warned, it can be very loud, especially when they bring in a DJ. I'd recommend going early, and always look to make reservations online beforehand (even a couple days in advance)!",newamerican
1253,5.0,woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ,"One of my favorite modern mexican places in Pittsburgh for a night out! 

The ambience is very dark and intimate, on the weekends they usually have a DJ. Overall, a great place for date night (however, it does get pretty loud during the evening)! The tortillas are homemade and you can see them preparing the tacos at the front of the restaurant. I have sat at the tables and at the bar and honestly prefer the bar if dining with just two people. Allows you to be closer for conversation and I have always had great bartenders! 

For appetizers, absolutely loved the guacamole. Very fresh with the right amount of kick! Would also recommend trying the chips and salsa. Always enjoy pairing this with some of their amazing margaritas which is a must try on the drink menu. Some of the best margaritas I have ever had in Pittsburgh! So far, my favorites have been the spicy pineapple and grapefruit. For small plates, highly recommend the street corn and papas bravas! The papas bravas is my favorite thing on the menu. For tacos, they may same pricey for two tacos (range is $13-$22), however they are worth it! All the friends who have visited from out of state who I have taken to this restaurant have always been very pleased with the flavors and quantity. If you're with a big group of people, would highly recommend getting the board of 12 tacos (6 pairs) so you can try multiple menu items. The only con is that this place isn't absolutely the best for vegetarians if looking for multiple choices. They always have one veggie taco option listed on the menu which changes depending on the season. I will say that they were very accommodating and did allow me to try a chorizo taco without the meat which I did think was delicious.",newamerican
1254,5.0,woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ,"This sweet little modern taco spot is to be enjoyed with a group of fun friends, sharing an order (or three) of tacos, while sipping on a delicious handcrafted margarita. I'm not even a marg fan, but this one (an original) was the best I have ever had. Tart and salty...just right. And the Korean tacos...on point. You watch them handmake their tortillas right in the open kitchen space of the restaurant. This is a place that radiates feel good vibes - check it out on a weekend night when the DJ is spinning old school jams!

I disagree with the reviews below about price. Let's not forget that you're right smack in the middle of downtown. You get what you pay for here with thoughtful food, service, and setting. If you're looking for just an average quick + cheap taco spot, this is not the place for you.

1255,2.0,woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ,"As the number one Yelp-rated restaurant in the area, I would expect a lot better of the food. I can't complain about anything else, as service/ambience was wonderful. 

I went around opening time at 5 PM last Saturday and was seated almost immediately at a table even though there was a line already forming. Service was great - we received menus + drinks pretty quickly. 

We ordered the classic Chorizo Fundido (a queso dip with tortillas? on the side), the Street Corn, and the Korean and Octopus tacos. 

Chorizo Fundido was a very tasty dip made of shishito, scallions, and cilantro paired with flour tortillas, which honestly came in a disproportionately small amount - we had way too much dip for the 4 tortillas we were eating. This dish would probably be better paired with tortilla chips.

Street corn was great! No complaints here.

The Korean and Octopus taco looked great - I had read amazing reviews about them on here but when I bit into them, I couldn't enjoy them at all. Both tacos were overly salted to the point that I was unable to properly indulge in the other ingredients that comprised the taco. Management offered to replace the tacos but I honestly wasn't hungry and had already finished my tacos (I know, I shouldn't have). 

I don't think that this should be happening at a restaurant prided to be the number one rated restaurant, and especially at the price point for each taco ($16/22 respectively). I would love to come back and try their tacos again to see what they really are like but my experience here honestly did not set a good note for any future endeavors.",newamerican
1256,5.0,woXlprCuowrLJswWere3TQ,"Hold the phone and get to downtown Pittsburgh immediately, if you've not been to this kick-ass spot! Wife and I shared a bar-side meal on a recent weekend night, and we had a super-fun time with an excellent meal to boot! the upstairs DJ was spinnin' the tunes and the two bartendresses (is that a word?) took good care of us and seemed to be enjoying what they did best.

As we had a long drive home (to the next state over), we did forego any drinks, but they have an extensive selection of tequillas and could whip up just about any related cocktail you wished (we'll have to do that next time!).

As for our meal, we did our typical shtick and ordered a bunch of dishes to share. We chose the street corn, papas bravas, (fried) artichoke tacos and an order of carnitas tacos.

The street corn was absolute perfection served with sriracha mayo, cotija cheese, chili powder and a slice of lime for squeezing. It was piping hot when it arrived and I had to restrain myself until it cooled so I could take bites...but it was hard to do! The papas bravas is their take on a classic Spanish dish (patatas bravas) that comes fried topped with a spicy tomato sauce along with a creamy garlic mayo based sauce. It is kind of a heavy dish and basically put us in a carb coma. The (fried) artichoke tacos came served with peashoots, crispy chiles and a crema sauce...not our favorite dish, but an unusualy and tasty alternative to a meat-based taco. The carnitas tacos however, was the rock star dish served with house-made guacamole, pickled red onions, chicharrones (fried pig skin) and a tangy salsa verde.  We scarfed those things down like nobody's business!

I loved the open-air kitchen concept and streetside dining option (wish there were seats open there!), but the vibe inside the restaurant was totally chill and the bar area was hoppin' and happening.

My tots were incredible. I'm not a big ketchup fan but their homemade ketchup was yummy. 

My bacon was fatty and undercooked. Could be my fault since I didn't specify but I didn't eat it.

They also ran out of almond milk so that sort of stunk for the drinks we initially wanted.

We sat outside and were seated right away, just beat the rush as it soon became busy. We were very hungry: ordered the cinnamon roll as an appetizer to split, the breakfast pizza to split, the eggs benedict with shrimp, and the burrito (mostly pictured in my added photos to this review). They were all quite delicious however the portions are pretty large for me and we had a lot of leftovers. The pizza wasn't my favorite but it was different. The burrito I ate the other half for breakfast the next day (today!).

I didn't take a photo of the menu, regrettably, but I thought it was sort of limited for breakfast/lunch however the restaurant isn't all that big either so it is expected. I really like the location despite the parking issue as you're in the center of Pitt's campus and it is just a beautiful location to sit outside and get a nice view of Oakland/enjoy the outdoor area.

I thought they could have added a touch more of the ingredients in the bowl too. It's a large bowl, but was mostly the salad mix. It's supposed to have cucumbers, lime pickled onions, red cabbage, pickled carrots, egg, and almonds with a carrot ginger dressing. I also would have preferred more dressing, as it was on the light side. They don't ask you how heavy you want the dressing, which is what I like about Hello Bistro.

I recommend coming here early because the space is small and fills up very fast. A very good decision on my end. I ended up coming here twice and tried the cheesy grits, the cookies and cream pie, and the chocolate chess pie.

Cheesy Grits- This is my first time trying grits, and definitely not my last. It has a deliciously cheesy and fluffy taste as you shove it into your mouth. Still not really sure what grits taste like, but if this is it, then I love it.

Cookies and Cream Pie- Still obsessing about this in my head. This is the lightest and creamiest pie I have ever eaten. The sweet cream contrasts the bitter chocolate crust perfectly. I can confidently say that this is the best pie I have ever eaten in my life. Hands down.

Chocolate Chess Pie- I don't know what I was expecting this to taste like, but I was a bit confused. It tasted like a brownie with a crust. Nonetheless, it was really good! However, I expected a lighter texture rather than a dense chocolate brownie.

Overall, this place is definitely recommended! I would absolutely try more of their pies!",newamerican
1279,5.0,tQRcO-C-5gZxxUo9lHbexg,"My husband and I loved this place! In fact, we ate there two days in a row. We were there for work and it was nearby. Both days we had breakfasts that were phenomenal. My eggs were scrambled to perfection (with just a bit of cheese) and my husband loved his sunny side eggs. The toast is scrumptious. Bacon and sausage were good, and the coffee was strong and kept coming. 

Our server was Chris both times, and he was super friendly without being obtrusive. The second day I ventured to ask him about the Vinegar Pie (there's a good description the back of everyone's shirt, but I needed more info) and he explained that yes, it's very much like Pecan Pie. He also told me it was an Appalachian specialty. I got some to go and it was amazing! All the staff there are kind, and you can also see that they're supportive of each other as well. Breakfast joints are stressful places to work, and they're nailing it. 

Also, I love the Pie Man logo so much I bought a couple mugs as gifts. (I'm not one to photograph my food.) I would have taken pictures of the place itself (the wall of mirrors is so fun!) but people are busy eating and having a good time in there. Wonderful spot.",newamerican

We both got one of the regular pies which change throughout the week. There were 3 options so we decided on the chocolate mousse pie! This isn't a traditional pie with a dough crust, but it is one DELICIOUS pie for sure! They also have fruit pies! 

Then, I got the 2 eggs with bacon, Anandama toast, and mujadara. I have never heard of or tried the last two sides so I was excited! Anandama toast is a salt-rising bread toast so it is very thick yet has a slight molasses sweetness. It was SO perfect paired with butter, my eggs and the mujadara which was a lentil curry-flavored rice! 

My boyfriend got the two buttermilk pancakes with chocolate chips which of course, was thick and drool-worthy! The staff was friendly and the decor inside is cute: mirrors, bright colors, booths, tables, window seats, and a bar!

1286,4.0,Zp2vJfHciG9IiXfmtH5Wdw,"There is nothing I like better during a day stuck at work for breakfast, lunch and dinner than to figure out where to order food delivery. Dinner delivery options in Pittsburgh has gotten so advanced, it's easy to explore beyond the realms of traditional pizza and Chinese with the advent of Yelp, Grubhub and Postmates. 

I had ordered a quick work lunch from Beta Bites before and had eaten their falafel panini and fries with a couple wings. I loved their falafel taste but didn't love the panini compression of the sandwich. I would definitely order something falafel from them again, just not that. The fries were crispy and well seasoned, the wings crispy and good and served with ranch dressing. I had to add seasoning and hot sauce to the wings but the base flavor was good. Their food was good enough for me to order from them again. 

What had interested me about Beta was that they offer a lamb and rice meal that looked pretty darn tasty in their thumbnail pic. I wasn't hungry enough to commit to that order though previously. Fortunately, I had a chance the other night to order the lamb and rice. It was pretty epic for food delivery. I don't know too many places that deliver an authentic Mediterranean lamb dinner. The lamb was deliciously braised and tender and the rice was a surprising star of its own. Very well seasoned the lamb and rice. It came with the choice of two sides; I had lentils  and salad with their Beta house dressing. 

The lamb and rice was large enough to share, which was awesome, because I got to split and share their Kafta Morrito. Beta has a line of Moroccan themed burritos called ""morritos""(?) Is that a thing? Oh my goodness, their Kafta (middle eastern seasoned meatball) is crave-worthy. I. highly recommend the Kafta Morrito, the lamb and rice dinner  and anything falafel for food delivery. Though they offer standard wings, fries and pizza for the college neighborhood in which they're based, I think their strength is in their mediterranean fare. Their prices are super reasonable too.

1289,1.0,QQ4763IteaX73s6-1d68dw,"This review is in regard to their brunch. I had some friends in town and we went here around 12:30 on a Sunday. There was only us and another table. We were greeted right away and were told we could sit anywhere. Our waitress was pleasant, but we were confused if she was our waitress or this other gentleman who started to take care of us as soon as things started to fall apart was our waiter... Anyway...

For only having a total of 6 people in the whole restaurant, it took the kitchen almost (or maybe it was...?) 30 minutes to make 4 breakfast sandwiches. Also, we ordered cinnamon-swirl bread and didn't initially receive it because the waitress ""completely forgot about it."" (Not sure how this happens with only two tables in the whole restaurant...) In addition, I thought the bread (which was technically french toast and I wouldn't have ordered it if I knew it was french toast) was lacking cinnamon and the ""vanilla icing"" on top was clear with virtually no taste. Vanilla icing should be white, not clear. That was odd and not good. Thankfully our ...waiter?...manager?... comped it. 

The breakfast sandwiches were not very good. The toast for my sandwich was like toasted and then maybe fried...? Or maybe it was extremely stale bread...either way, it was an extremely odd and hard texture for simple white toast. The home fries were not very good. I typically don't put ketchup on my homefries, but I had to with these ones because they lacked flavor and not all the homefries were consistently cooked properly. We also had to ask for salt and pepper as it was not at the table or brought out with our food.

When we got our split checks, the guy waiter (or manager) flip flopped 2 of our checks and he had to go back and void the original transaction. (Once again, I could forgive this, but not with only 6 people in the whole place.)

It worries me when this many things can go wrong when a restaurant is virtually empty. I will not return and would advise others to cross the Hot Metal Bridge and find somewhere else in the south side.",newamerican

The good...
- The rooftop area is good on a nice day.  They have a shade sail and it's a relaxing space.  One walk up window for drinks and a limited food menu up there.   
- The service overall was good.  The rooftop lost my tab, but when I asked if I could just take care of it downstairs with my dinner tab, she said yes.  Nice and easy.  I reminded the downstairs service at the beginning and end of the meal, but it never appeared on my bill.  She finally came around and just said it was on the house.  No problem there!   
- The decor.  The industrial theme is well done and the place has a nice feel to it.   

The eh...
- The food.  This was the main reason that it got downgraded.   The Korean wings were syrupy sweet - way too sweet.  Nice spice level, but so sweet.  Same with the salad I ordered.  It was huge and had a ton of toppings, which I loved; but again, it was very sweet.  
- The menu.  I had looked on Eliza's website and picked out what I wanted to order, but the new menu didn't have either of those things.  If you are gonna put it out there, make sure it's right.   
- Signage.  Am I allowed to park in the lot?  No idea.  Is this unmarked side door what I'm supposed to use for the restaurant?  No idea.  Rooftop bar?  Total guess.   Improvement needed there for sure.",newamerican

I had not been to Pittsburgh since last century. It was around the same time of year around 1997. Landing there this time on a late night flight meant I didn't get to see much on the ride to the downtown Marriott there. I checked in just before the last call for the hotel's restaurant.
I was exhausted from an all nighter because I had a flight cancellation from Tampa to New York around 4am. So I had to scamper to continue my meetings remotely. 
It was supposed to be a Tampa-New York early morning flight and a New York-Pittsburgh evening flight. But I had to get the last available flight after my meetings. And it was a Tampa-Pittsburgh flight with a change of planes in Atlanta. 
I hate connecting flights. With one hour connections you barely make it from one gate to the other, as happened on my outbound flight. On the return I ended up at Atlanta airport for four hours waiting for a delayed connection. It just adds unneeded drama or life-sucking time-wasting delays. 
In any case, I got to the Pittsburgh Marriott City Center. I had not even had time for a proper lunch. I avoid heavy meals late at night, especially near midnight when I have to up at 6 am for 7 am meetings. However, at the Marriott the menu choices were limited. But at least they had a place open. 
Since childhood I've been too much of a red-meat lover. So I ordered this filet mignon with crab cake, veggies, and mashed potatoes. 
Much that the meat and meal could be rated as great, and much that I'm grateful for every meal, fancy or otherwise, I'm blessed to have, I have to warn you -- this steak must have been marinated in a salt mine! 
I could literally feel my blood pressure rising from the salt intake.  But there was no time to ask for a change, so I imagined it was a chef special recipe that made it so salty.  I'd definitely order this again but hope someone there pays attention to the salt thrown in the meal.

1298,1.0,SHiJlYdxQmJur3i-gLf9MQ,"We frequent the Red Ring before many events at PPG Paints Arena.  Last year my debit card was hacked moments after I paid the bill (with little to nothing done by management) and last night was the doozy.

I was there with my son-in-law before the Pens home opener and we both ordered wings.  When they came out we bit into them and very cold and bloody.  Yikes!  Our server came over and immediately took them back and offered to get us a second order which we agreed.  About 15 minutes later our order came out and yikes again.  Piping hot on the outside but cold and bloody on the inside.  

This time I got up and went to our server and asked for the check.  When she first gave it to me we were charged for the wings, and I asked her to seek out a manager.  She came back to our table with a revised bill, apologized, then went back to her station to chat it up with her cohorts.

There are plenty of options and places to eat and think we'll skip the Red Ring.  Go Pens!",newamerican
1299,4.0,SHiJlYdxQmJur3i-gLf9MQ,"Another great option for lunch down near the Arena just down from Duquesne. I wasn't sure what to expect walking in but this place was setup pretty nice and looks to be a bit higher class than I thought it would be being this close to campus. They had a lot of good lunch options including burgers, sandwiches and salads. Most come with an option of fries or homemade chips which I highly recommend. The chips come with a great French onion dip.

We ordered the Nachos and Soft Pretzels as appetizers and these both came out quickly. Both were excellent! The Pretzels were well made and super soft with a good cheese sauce while the Nachos came with chicken, baked on cheese along with fresh veggies including fresh chunks of avocado and raw jalapeño.  There was plenty to share and a table of five didn't finish them all.  For my entree I went with the Cheesesteak which didn't disappoint!  The horseradish/A1 combo was simply fantastic!  It was a large portion and had to be cut in half to easily eat. I already mentioned the chips/dip but it's worth saying again so make sure to try them.

The service was fine. Nothing over the top. She seemed friendly enough but didn't really go out of her way even though we were one of two tables at the time.  We did all have a laugh and point out that I was the only one not to receive a refill. I'm also the only one who got water. If you are paying for your drink, I guess it's a one time only deal haha!

1301,3.0,SHiJlYdxQmJur3i-gLf9MQ,"I can't believe I'd never reviewed the Red Ring. I used to LOVE this restaurant. It's close to the arena, the service is always very friendly, the food is decent, etc.

THEN, the female manager started interacting with us and I just haven't liked the place since. The service is still friendly and food is still okay, but the rude manager really makes an impact - especially since she encourages bad seating processes.

Once, we were going to have a party of 3 and were seated at a table for 6, though the restaurant was mostly empty and there were PLENTY of tables that seated 4 (our friend had to cancel, so we moved to a table of 4 knowing there would be only 2 of us and the table was used for a party of 5 later).

MANY times, we've been there with parties of 4 when they wouldn't seat us at a table for 6, since they think there may be a bigger party coming in later - they'd have tons of people waiting for tables and lots of available tables, but be unwilling to sit parties together (as they do in some busy bars that have poor table layouts) or sit a smaller party at a larger table. They do the same thing when there are 2 people and a bunch of tables that seat 4. We've been seated and gotten through our whole meal while couples waited to be seated, though there were empty tables. Kinda crazy that they would rather LOSE MONEY than seat people.

I've seen other reviews mentioning this female manager, which doesn't surprise me, since she has been rude 100% of the time we've dealt with her and we used to go to the Red Ring a lot more. We've gotten more and more annoyed with the management and tend to choose other restaurants so we don't have to deal with her.

The mac & cheese is cold 99.99% of the time when you first get it (one time it was warm - I almost passed out from shock). I'm not sure how they prepare it, but whatever they do, it'll sometimes have steam coming off, but it's always cold. Knowing this, I touch a noodle with a finger as soon as I get it and send it back to be warmed up. Usually, this is not an issue. The waiter/waitress or male manager takes it back to be heated, apologizes, etc. A couple times, our food has been delivered by the female manager. On those occasions, she has actually argued with me (though she SAW me touch the noodles with my finger to see if it was warm or not). Even if I had no feeling in that finger and I happened to be incorrect (not the case), I see no reason for a manager to argue with me over my food. We keep hoping he'll move on to another restaurant and give the Red Ring a try again occasionally. I read a review that said they're managed by Aramark, which surprised me, since Aramark tends to be a smart company and it doesn't seem like they'd want a manager who's always rude and chooses empty tables over tables with people at them so often. 

I've tried to find out how to contact the district manager (or even store manager if it's not the rude female manager), but I've had no luck. I've asked to speak with the male manager about the issues with the rude manager a couple times, but he's normally been too busy helping out, since we only go there before Penguins games. (I've had a good interaction with him over other issues earlier in our history with the Red Ring and think talking to him might be useful.)

If you decide to go there, get there well before any event, so you can be seated without issues. If you have any issues, try to get the male manager, since the only female manager we've seen there will NOT care at all and will probably just upset you more. 

The food is still decent and all the wait staff we've ever dealt with has been very friendly. If you don't have to deal with the female manager at all, I think the Red Ring is decent (I'd rate it a 4). If you do, I'd rate it a 1 at best. Good luck!",newamerican

I though the pickle place was going to be a variety of pickles, but it was a variety of pickled vegetables (peppers, cauliflower, carrots, etc) so I was a little disappointed but that was on me.

1303,2.0,7J4yrdfestwRJJa9XLey-Q,"This was my third time at Fairlane.  The first was shortly after they opened, and each time I've gone it has gotten worse.  On our first visit, my husband and I sat outside and shared a couple of appetizers, several drinks, and each had an entree.  The service, although slow, was friendly, and we both quite enjoyed the food.  (I can't quite remember our order, I know it was a gem salad, a burger, and the Kho Soi)   I remember the drinks were creative and yummy!   

Our second visit was for the fried chicken night with a group of friends.  Our food that evening was just okay.  I am a bit biased as I judged Fairlane's fried chicken night off of  Kaya's (Strip District) Thursday night fried chicken night and it came up lacking.  However, the drinks were still on point and we had a nice evening. 

My third (and final) visit, was this past Wednesday with my father.  We arrived around 6:30 to a mostly empty restaurant and were seated in a very dark corner next to the pitch black party room.  Our waitress on this night was not particularly friendly.  I inquired about happy hour specials and was curtly informed that they were for the bar only and that they were over at 7....okaaay...at this point, I just stuck with water.  We both ordered the burger.  Now, normally when I go out with my Dad we like to have an appetizer and a couple of drinks before our meal, however, there was an unfriendly vibe that we both picked up on and just wanted to eat and go.  When the burger arrived (which, btw, I raved about to him from our first visit) we were overwhelmed with the size and presentation.   It was huge, looked delicious and came with a heaping mound of fries!   However, at first bite of the burger, we both were disappointed.  There was an odd seasoning (juniper, perhaps?) that we both found to be strange.  We picked around the burger, ate some fries and the house smoked bacon.  The rest of our meal was packed up for our dogs!

I came for brunch and was so pleasantly surprised. Upon first glance at the menu, I was worried there wouldn't be much that was gluten free for me, but the server checked and I was good to go with the frittata or tomato and burrata. I do LOVE that tomato dish normally, but knew I'd be hungry after an hour if I just ate that, so opted for the frittata and ordered a side of breakfast potatoes. 

The frittata was so tasty and had this nice crispy top to it that I thoroughly enjoyed. The breakfast potatoes were good, but I didn't realize there was an aioli hidden on the side of the dish until over halfway through. Aioli is the best, so I'd love to see more added to the dish, as it was just a little dollop. 

My only two critiques are the potatoes could have used just a tad more seasoning and maybe slightly crispier (with more aioli). The frittata was great. Now I realize I am a complete and total snob with tea, but they carry Lipton. For such a beautiful space, I'd say is elevated American fare, I'd offer a little more upscale tea... or why not go local and carry Gryphon's (my fave tea in the city!). I realize I'm ridiculous though, so just a small suggestion, because really all I want is the wine. Speaking of... 

They have a decent sized bottleshop with wine and beer on the other side of the restaurant. You can even fill up growlers to go from their tap selection. The wine cooler is what entices me. The selection looked awesome and I can't wait to dive into that when I'm not pregnant!

1310,5.0,3H1I31BQeHO017Sg92Cbow,"A hidden gem! I came here yesterday for a Galentine's meal with my friends and was pleasantly surprised to find that the food was DELICIOUS. 

It's important to note that the restaurant is sectioned into two parts: a standing bar, which you walk into at first, and a sit down table area. When my friend first walked in to snag a table, she thought had walked into the wrong place since she was the youngest one there at the bar. However she was soon escorted to the seating area. This area had walls covered in what seemed like vintage framed posters- with a twist. The table itself was nicely decorated with flowers and intimate candle lighting.

We decided to order the steak $26, sweet potato ravioli $19, and fried chicken bucket $30 (recommended for two but we shared for three). We also got their pork meatballs $6 and Brussels sprouts $9. I have to say the meatballs were tender- fantastic- and the Brussels sprouts sweet but crispy. I'm not the biggest fan of Brussels sprouts but these were worth it. The ravioli tasted like a savory dessert and the chicken was very crispy. It had been dusted with seasoning and served with a side of mashed potatoes and coleslaw. 

The waitress was kind and came to check up on us/refill our water many times. We didn't order any drinks, but the meal itself was satisfying enough. I will say that the food is pricy. A $$$ kind of place. Also, the drink menu is definitely longer than the main menu. But overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere, decor, and food of this restaurant. I would come back again!",newamerican

I have now been there a few times and the ONLY reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because the servers here could be much more personable. Each time I am hoping it's a different experience from the waitstaff. They practically ignore you and barely smile. It's a real shame because if it weren't for that, I'd prob go here more regularly and give it a much higher rating.",newamerican

Chips and mango salsa was good but untraditional.  Wife got seabass which was a very small serving but very nicely presented.  Rissotto side dish with peas was very good.

I had a seafood pasta with shrimp.  Good not great.

Not sure I'll be back.  Aspinwall pricing I guess.",newamerican

1317,5.0,QGPQp5VsRcP5Ma0ekCgj2Q,"NU has quickly become a go-to brunch spot for us because of how incredible the food and service are. I'm almost embarrassed of how often we have brunch at NU during the weekend. 

My favorite dish is the LEO- lox, eggs, and caramelized onions with caper cream cheese. It's simple but divine. The NU Benny is a delightful twist on Eggs Benedict with your choice of breakfast meat and light flavorful Hollandaise. The Reuben is a hit with my partner. 

The nosh bar is a delightful spread of house-made mini bagels, macaroni and cheese, greens, challah bread pudding, Israeli salad, blueberry kuchen and more. They'll also bring out liver spread for you if you're inclined. 

The wait staff are great and make you feel right at home. They're speedy but don't make you feel rushed. 

We've taken a preschooler, a picky eater, and a brunch snob here. Everyone was happy. There's a kids menu and you can't go wrong with the Goy--slab bacon and eggs to order. 

Check out NU if you're looking to elevate your brunch. Life pro tip: it's BYOB. Bring some bubbly and make a next-level mimosa with their fresh OJ.",newamerican
1318,4.0,QGPQp5VsRcP5Ma0ekCgj2Q,"You got $20 for breakfast? Come here! It'll be well worth your while. 

Next door is Pamela's, which is great, but obviously very crowded! You can just walk into here through the Pamela's entrance, and when you do, it's so much less crazy. Lots of tables, friendly waitstaff, colorful interior. It's gorgeous! 

When ordering, in order to get the ""nibble 'n' nosh"" mini buffet bar, you have to order an entree. Though considering how delicious the stuff was, it's not a mini buffet bar! If you're trying to diet and watch your portions, I don't recommend sitting directly next to it (which I did)! Mini-bagels, coconut shrimp, stewed tomatoes....as well as the traditional cut fruit and some lovely little desserts (blueberry walnut cake, apple walnut ""kurchen"", and choc chip cake bites). Everything is bite sized and worth a try, though the bagels are a little tougher. I think that's traditional for this kind of bagel. 

I ordered the ""Nu Benny"" with lox and with the hollandaise on the side, the last option which I highly recommend! The food came out within 10 minutes of my ordering, which you'd expect when it's not as busy. Fantastic service, great food! They offered me chopped liver, which, unlike the old saying goes, is actually fantastic. I've never had it before. And they make it in house. 

The Nu Benny was delicious, and I do not recommend salting or peppering the eggs-there's already so much flavor in the whole thing, at least with the lox. Some hot sauce could enrich the taste, in moderation! It's your typical bagel lox with a bit more deliciousness added! No cream cheese came with it, though I think it worked well regardless. 

Overall, great experience! I didn't like that I was charged $3.00 for the tea, but that's partly why I usually stick to water! Give this place a try. I double dog dare you!",newamerican

It has its role in the Pittsburgh restaurant scene.  This being said, I do not understand why most people would wait in line at Pamela's when there is this gem right next door, with no wait.

First off, the nosh table (a buffet style table included with all the entres). Oh em geee... as any carb lover knows, bagels are fantastic.  You want to know what is better? Homemade bagels that as fresh and still a bit warm.  Chewy, tasty, fluffy clouds of reasons why I need to run on the treadmill every day.  Add to that potato latke, coconut shrimp (which I am allergic to, but hear is very good) and an assortment of deserts, salads, spreads, and breads. You might fill up on the nosh before your meal arrives (I often do).  Yet somehow I am also able to find that second stomach, you know the one used for to make space for ice cream after a large meal, to enjoy my entree.  I enjoyed the Reuben, super flavorful, fresh, and warm.  The meat was quality, the sauerkraut delicious, and everything was in balance.  I also had a bite of the brisket, and boy was it tasty as well.

Now I honestly don't know why everyone waits an hour or more for Pamela's when this wonderful brunch place is right next door!  My favorite part was the ""nosh table"" which was included with any brunch entree and included several savory and sweet items, including coconut shrimp, haluski, biscuits, desserts, homemade mini bagels, etc. They also bring out cream cheese, sour cream and pate to go with the various bread items.  I ordered the Leo for my entree which was house cured lox, scrambled eggs, and cream cheese with scallions and it was so delicious! The service was excellent and very personable.  The waitress talked about how invested the owner is in her business and how she makes everything thoughtfully from scratch.  The brunch items are definitely more savory oriented with fewer vegetarian options, so some people may find options they prefer at Pamela's with their hotcakes, but for those who love egg-based dishes, definitely check this place out!

So we live in Squirrel Hill and stop by this place fairly frequently.  They do a good burger and a good brunch.   And I appreciate that I can swap out the side for sweet potato fries or tater tots.  Wine is a buck too high for the selections, but even that is fine.   Service is always friendly and efficient enough.   

So why three stars?   The ladies bathroom is just plain gross.  It really makes me not even want to eat there.   There is dark grime everywhere.

The food is good, but nothing really stands out about it. It is your typical America fare bar food that comes with a side of fries (maybe the best food they have). I generally just get a wrap or a burger. 

They do have a full bar, but I wish they had more beers on tap. They do have a solid bottle selection, but I prefer drafts and they only have six, with only 2-3 crafts. 

The service is nice and the ambiance is casual. The place is a bit cramped at times, but is good for groups of 2-4. You can find parking nearby usually without too much trouble. The price point here is about right, no qualms there. I'll be back as squirrel hill only has a few bars restaurants similar to MAG.",newamerican

The servers and greeter were all super friendly and courteous. I got the brisket sandwich and my wife go the crab cake sandwich which were both amazingly delicious. She had also gotten a French onion soup which I'm usually not a fan of, but I tried it and just had to order another one for myself. Oh and the sweet potato fries were very crispy and fresh as well.

Then that chef quit.
We didn't return for about a year ...
So, we were in the area for other business and decided to stop in and see how they were making out.
Well ... Not good!
Ordered the Crab eggs benidict on wheat toast.
The toast came out burned (see photo) ...
Listen ... I've burned toast many of times ...
But I didn't server it, I threw it away.
This toast was burned on one side and not toasted on the other ???
How do you take a piece of totally burned toast and then add the eggs and other topping on top????
With this kind of mentality, the main question is what else are they doing back in that kitchen that you don't know about?!?!?!
The Breakfast for (2) two of these Eggs benidict and (2) two coffees with tip came to $48.00.

In all fairness, my fiancé tried the same dish twice (the Smoked Salmon Belly with potatoes, green beans, and egg) and realized that she really didn't like it the first time either.  Here's why.  They don't ""clean"" the fish so you end up with these rubbery, thick pieces of wet salmon skin mixed in with your salmon.  It's very unappetizing.  I tried the Benedict with smoked salmon and a side of potatoes and it was good.

Our server was younger and didn't seem to have much experience.  She was absent a lot and not very attentive when she was there as she forgot to bring waters after two requests and then had no reaction whatsoever when we pointed out the salmon skin issue.  That was a real letdown because we were not rude about it all and it was obvious we left a lot of the dish uneaten.  An apology would have been appropriate.",newamerican

It was a nice portion size and tasted great. The wife got the hamburger and noted that the fries were a bit salty, but overall was satisfied with her meal. 

I ordered a wine as they have a large selection to choose from. One downside was that they do not have beers on draft and I love draft beer.

The menu looked similar to what Ease offered- just slimmed down. The kids menu is exactly the same from what I remembered. My daughter ordered the pasta and applesauce. I ordered the FPT burger - no bacon. It was REALLY good. The onion ring was a nice touch. My husband ordered the chicken sandwich and he had no complaints. 
We ordered the seasonal fruit tart for dessert. I wasn't a huge fan. Not sure if I'm the best critic since I don't usually eat dessert.

Frick Park Tavern is a great addition to Regent Square!

The decor was home-y but modern and was perfect for the space.  The atmosphere was inviting for couples, friends, and families.  They have a great selection of beer, wine and cocktails and their menu has something for everyone.  There are a lot of salads and sandwiches but a nice selection of entrees to help round out the menu and make this restaurant great for a casual dinner or a nice night out.

We started with the candied chili bacon and the fig and bleu tart.  The bacon is a must get and the tarts were good - I would have liked a little more bleu cheese but that is a personal preference.  I ordered the Nature Trail which was good but I would try something different next time.  My husband got the Pnkerton and that cocktail is a must try if you enjoy smokey cocktails.

For our main meals I ordered the double cut pork chop (after seeing a sneak peak video on their instagram) and my husband got Jimmy's Special Meatloaf.

Restaurants with huge menu are an automatic fail IMO. FPT does it right in that regard. 

Pan-Roasted Salmon: cooked and seasoned to perfection. 

Crispy Calamari: The squid pieces are small, so you taste more of the batter than squid. A little bland overall, and not really crispy. I do like the occasional fried pickle they mix in there that added some flavor.  

FPT Salad: too much vinaigrette. I was a huge fan of their salad back when FPT was Ease. It was served in a big stainless steel bowl, well mixed with perfect amount of dressing. But the FPT salad was a letdown. Way too sour. I couldn't even finish it. Served on a plate so it's hard to toss the salad without accidentally dropping bits on the table. 

FPT Burger: Burger's top-notch. Even more impressive was the fries. Among the best fries I have ever had - thick and crunchy. Rosemary sea salt was a great touch.

Buttermilk Fried Chicken Salad: Great pairing. Chicken was tender and juicy; good salad. Portion was small for an entrée but big for an appetizer, so I'd consider adding another protein option if for entrée.",newamerican
1347,4.0,1XdWZTPXPRRaE0SsEbHcQQ,"A hidden gem! Usually people don't go to museums for their cafes, so I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the cafe was open for brunch and served up a pretty good menu. The ambiance was very nice, with classy decorations and a good view. I enjoyed the light display and the tall windows that allowed diners to see the pleasing fountain display.

For a Saturday morning it wasn't too busy and my friend and I were able to secure a table without a reservation. The staff was cordial and helpful. Our waitress made some pretty good suggestions regarding the menu. Everything seemed delicious and there appeared to be good vegetarian selections as well. 

We took her suggestion and ordered the Bocadillo di Tortilla for $13 and a short stack of pancakes for $7. The name tortilla is a bit misleading: it's actually a sandwich with two thick slices of bread around arugula, manchego, aioli and an egg, spinach, and potato frittata. The sandwich was decent. The crispiness of the bread paired well with the soft frittata. However, it wasn't too outstanding, I'm not sure if I would order it again. It was nice to try it. I would consider it a good experiment as opposed to what I usually order. Although the short stack seemed small it was still quite filling and soaked well with maple syrup. The pancake was soft and fluffy, very satisfying.  The portions were quite generous so we ended up packing up our leftovers.

1350,3.0,1XdWZTPXPRRaE0SsEbHcQQ,"I have mixed feelings about The Café Carnegie. It is an absolutely beautiful place to visit for breakfast or lunch and it's a refreshing alternative to the other options on S Craig Street. 

Pros: An incredible option for a coffee meeting with a colleague or business prospect during the week. The coffee prices are average and they have some tasty options including their nitro cold brew. This is a great alternative to the small Starbucks that is close by. It can be quiet here before lunch, so it's also a great place to have a coffee and get some work done or study. 

Cons: Not the best lunch casual lunch option. The prices are steep and the portions are small. The food is good, but it's not great enough to justify the high cost. If you are looking for a more formal place to meet a business prospect it can be a great option, but it's not great when you're really hungry and not looking to spend a chunk of change for lunch.

Overall, I really do love the Café Carnegie as a place to meet people and have coffee. Maybe I will try it out for lunch another time, but for now I am sticking with the coffee",newamerican

I tried out the Fried Chicken Sandwich with a side of fries which seems to be a go to for many people. The sandwich is pretty good, but it was pretty plain... I was expecting a bit more from it not going to lie. But the bun and pickles made it better! The fries were a good compliment for it.

I'd like to come here again and try out another meal to see if everything is plain or just the sandwich. I recommend this spot for a work lunch or drinks!",newamerican

We stopped by for lunch on a work day and were immediately seated and waited on. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable and promptly delivered our drinks and took our order. 

We both ordered the seasonal quiche with mixed greens, and it was amazing! The mixed greens were fresh and the house dressing was delicious. The quiche was loaded with spinach and cheddar cheese and basically melted in our mouths. We both ate everything, as it was so good! The portion size was perfect for lunch, too.",newamerican

We tried an array of appetizers and their wings definitely stood out to me. For dinner, I had to try their burger which was good. Only complaint was that it was so salty that the rest of the ingredients fell sort of flat.

We had great service though and I would stop here again.",newamerican

This was our ""fancy"" night of the trip so we dressed up and made a reservation. 
The restaurant is attached to a hotel, but you can enter from the hotel side or the street side. It kind of has an under ground feeling because you right below street level. Dark decor and fancy lighting make this restaurant very romantic. 
I ordered a glass of white wine to start and my boyfriend ordered a beer. They have a great wine and beer list and some fancy cocktails too. 
For dinner I ordered the tikka masala with tofu and my boyfriend ordered lobster pasta. We also got herb fries to share and a lemon berry cake for dessert. Fantastic meal and fantastic service!

1357,4.0,wKlH90YB5RYFvJ8N3pstVw,"I'm glad I finally got the opportunity to try out this place. You can enter either the bar side inside the Union Trust Building or the main entrance on William Penn way. Since I arrived shortly after opening I had my pick of where I wanted to sit. The dining area is small but certain booths can accommodate a group of about 5 people.

WiFi is free. Passcode available upon request. I had a very nice and attentive waitress who took care of all my needs. I had heard that they are known for their potato bread. It normally sells for $6.00 as a 1st course so I looked for a way to save money and still sample it. The lunch menu gave me that opportunity to try the potato bread on a sandwich so I opted for the fried trout sandwich accompanied by a grain and vegetable salad as my side. I got my food fairly quickly. The sandwich was a big! It came with tartar sauce as well as cucumbers and romaine lettuce gracing it. I found it enjoyable since it wasn't too greasy.

The grain salad was okay. Nothing to write home about. The menu does give vegetarian options but there are no vegan choices. There are gluten free options as well. This place is good for the working if you have a businessman's lunch. Expect to pay otherwise. Reservations are recommended if you come during peak operating times. Brunch is served on weekends. Located in the Union Trust Building, there is a parking garage nearby and public transportation is available.",newamerican

What I didn't love was that there were two large parties that reserved most of the bar seats. Not that there were butts in those seats, but they were reserved. Okay, so I sat in front of the oyster display case. It's a terribly uncomfortable spot that made it hard to talk to the bartenders. 

Nice little selection of oysters. Very limited menu before 5pm, when the dinner menu comes from upstairs. I wasn't impressed with the bar menu and didn't have time before my Uber to wait for the dinner menu - oysters it is. The bartender did find me a Gose in a can, that wasn't on the menu - which also meant there was no price listed. I asked the price before ordering my second but that seemed to be an ordeal. The bar is open beginning at 3pm or 4pm however, the happy hour pricing doesn't start until 5pm. smh *don't sit there, sit here, what?, that's not available yet, can't get that yet....* It was more of a hassle to come here than it should have been.

I've only been twice, so maybe I've come on bad nights. 
It feels crowded. It feels like they had some grand ideas but didn't fully execute them. It doesn't feel like a speak easy. It feels like a fancy basement bar. 
The drinks are expensive and I felt we're not up to the price point. Maybe I'm a cheapskate. Maybe I'm used to throwing together my own drinks. Maybe I didn't order things that matched well with my tastes.

Although I liked it, I wanted to try it when it was made at a speakeasy or something like that an the speakeasy at the Omni William Penn was perfect for that. 

It was a nice relaxing night, great conversation and charcuterie board (special of the week) was a wonderful pairing. I also tried their Manhattan (my normal go-to) and it was equally well made. 

Only negative is that I feel like this place would be a hit or miss and you can't really plan to go there. By the time we left at 9 pm on a Thursday they were at max capacity (47 people - due to fire codes).

The Speakeasy at the Omni William Penn is perfect for groups and special occasions and I've never had a subpar experience here. From the service, to the quality of the drinks and the ambiance, and even down to the sweet/salty bar snacks, everything has always been nothing but perfect. 

This is one of the few bars in the city that really offers the ""speakeasy vibe"" that I'm usually looking for in a bar, as well as the caliber of classic cocktails (Old Fashioneds, Manhattans, Vieux Carres, etc.) 

* Parking: Street parking downtown can be a little tricky unless you come late at night; hotel valet is always an option though.

* Pro Tip: The Speakeasy doesn't offer reservations, so having to wait on a crowded night is a possibility, but thankfully I've been lucky (and usually come late night) and have never had to wait.",newamerican

On my most recent trip I had the Bigelow burger.  The meat did not seem like it was fresh ground, which at the price they charge for the burger it should be.  It just seemed to uniform and did not have a fresh flavor.  The burger was cooked properly which I appreciated, however it was just an average burger.

1372,3.0,GkYPYQC_H_gKWsalG7dk8A,"Due to the location and the fact that I've worked within steps of Bridges for the past decade I've dined here many times - for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

The breakfast options are pretty good with a nice assortment of omelets.  I believe they have a breakfast buffet occasionally but I haven't had that for several years.

They will give discounts to Pitt employees for lunch, which is nice.  Good assortment of burgers and sandwiches and some interesting pizzas.  Prices for lunch are a little high.  

I like Bridges best for happy hour when the weather is nice.  They have an excellent patio outside that can accommodate large and small groups.  They have specials on drafts and appetizers.  

If you're in town for business and staying at the hotel this is a nice option for a meal.  If you're here to visit campus with potential Pitt students I'd suggest going out and about in Oakland to try something else - this is more of a business persons restaurant and not a fun college student spot.

Servers are typically very friendly and hardworking.",newamerican

Open Table offered 1,000 points for a reservation. So, why not? The first night I went with a friend and it was pretty empty. There were 2-3 people at the bar and later someone ate at the table behind us. Other than this, no one else came in for the night. Our waitress was super personable and helpful throughout the night. We ordered the Spinach Dip and Pub Pretzels with Beer Cheese with drinks (I had The Rum Runner) which were surprisingly good. The second night I came back with two friends and went for the whole shabang! Burger, fries, drinks, and dessert (for me at least). Burger was decent. Fries needed more flavor. Rum Runners were super strong and heavy on the rum. Strawberry Cake was okay; the ice cream had huge chunks of ice. We had the same waitress from the first night, and she's awesome. I wish the food and drinks lived up to her personality. Oh, more people were present on the second night which was nicer. I'll continue to explore the menu here and find what's good.",newamerican

How silly of me to make a reservation on OpenTable, because many empty seats were available, the reservation time was only 15 minutes before they closed, and the seating hostess could not find my reservation in her book. The scrambled eggs were so dry and clumpy that I took only one bite. The bacon, fruit, potatoes, etc. did NOT taste good. The made-to-order omelette tasted OK. For the below-average quality of the food, the $40-plus price tag for two people was extremely overpriced. They should be ashamed of themselves for not being able to cook such simple food. In addition, I had to wave my arms in the air to employees to refill my water, because they were busy debating whether Dollar Tree or Dollar General is the better store.

French fries were old,  I really can't say enough bad things about our meal.  Oh wait! Yes I can,  totally overpriced and almost all premade frozen food. 
You should consider firing your chef, because nothing good is coming out of that kitchen. Even the desserts were all premade and frozen.  It's obvious whoever is in charge of the kitchen has given up on life, doesn't care at all and should probably go back to whatever hispital they came from.

Our first night we hit the bar after touring the University of Pittsburgh and we simply needed a break before heading up to the room.

Pretzels and cheese dip were awesome and the drinks were on point. We stopped down here one other time while we were here and the bartender REALLY knew her bourbons...found me at least one new one to buy for myself.

The offerings are diverse: French toast, eggs, bacon, sausage, omelet station, waffles, roast beef, ham, etc. You can easily get your money's worth here, but if you're not going to partake in the carving stations, it might not be worth it. Then again, $14 for a plate of French toast on the main menu isn't really worth it either. So, maybe you're better off with the buffet. 

I caught the buffet at the wrong time. The French toast was hard. The bacon was just about depleted, and it wasn't restocked while I was there. The sausage was meh. Breakfast potatoes so-so. The big plate of fruit that I got on my second trip through the buffet was more satisfying. 

The service was great. My server was cordial and social.

Right after we sat down, he offered us a three course meal option which we politely declined. From there, I felt like he felt slighted and essentially ignored us the rest of the night. He seemed irritated when talking to us, never asked how our food was, never refilled our water, and when the drinks and food came out slow - he never apologized. We get our food, and there was a hair in my food which I never mentioned until the very end when he literally kicked us out of our table although we were still finishing dessert. Not to mention, when my friend picked her dessert he told her not to get it and to pick anything but that. He complained when we asked to split the tab saying we should have asked in the beginning, then split the tab entirely wrong so we ended up having to split it evenly amongst the three of us, again not apologizing. We would have mentioned it in the beginning if we knew that was the policy. 

I completely understand feeling tired and having a long day, as it can be a demanding job, but I felt like his behavior was extremely inappropriate and condescending. I have never felt such irritation from a staff member, and I feel like he was disrespectful the entire meal - which was quite expensive on top of it all. 

I am sure this isn't the case with every waiter, as we did have an older gentleman who came by who was extremely pleasant. But unfortunately this tainted the entire dining experience for me.",newamerican

I ordered the French Toast and a side of bacon. The the French Toast was good, not anything different or special from what I've had before. I liked that the bread was thick, but it was a little bit tough, especially the crust. The strawberries and syrup were great toppings and added a nice flavor to the slight vanilla taste of the toast. My bacon was crispy, a little overdone, but still tasty. I also ordered a mimosa, it was delicious and refreshing. Overall, a classy atmosphere and great for business events or a nicer meal.

For my meal I went went with the French dip.  This was one of the best French dips I have ever had.  The meat was tender,l and the horseradish sauce complimented it perfectly.  The bun was also one of the best parts of the sandwich.  Sometimes places will use cheap bread with a French dip which can cause the sandwich to become soggy or fall apart.  The bread here however was fresh, crisp, and stayed together when dipped in the au jus.  On the side they give you a mound of fries that no one person could finish.  They were also delicious.

I'm left asking myself why I continue to set myself up for disappointment. Food is alright -would probably taste better if it was what I ordered. 

UPDATE: ordered takeout again. Asked for a grilled chicken salad. Was given a piece of grilled chicken on bread. Embarrassing excuse for a sandwich (lettuce, tomato, onion??) aside from the fact that's not what I even ordered. Called and was told it happened because they were busy. Clearly uninterested in business.",newamerican

I ordered the burger medium rare but i think whoever cooked it, cooked it about 2 minutes too long then when they ran it under the broiler to melt the cheese it cooked the patty even more. So by the time I got it, it was medium well almost well done. It still had moisture though. As far as the rest of it goes, i thought it was perfect. The chips were perfectly cooked. 
     The fried pickles and wings were delicious. However, when they packed my order, they forgot to put blue cheese in. I ordered blue cheese and that shows on my receipt. So those minor details is why they got a 4 instead of a 5. I would order from here again though.",newamerican

So full disclosure, I live right down he street & have been to Hitchhiker brewing a handful of times (attached to Luma) BUT I have never even noticed this place. Thanks to GROUPON, I received $40 food voucher for $18. I will mention, that wine Wednesday ($5 glasses, and 1/2 price bottles) (and I'm sure all other specials) are not included with the voucher, you have to choose one of the other.

It's a hidden gem. When we arrived around 630 the restaurant was just starting to fill up. We weren't dressed properly (in the process of moving) so we sat at the bar area. The bar area is super nice, and the restaurant is lovely. Neon lights, very metropolitan vibe. The dining room is formal, cloth napkins, set tables, very nice! I even noticed an outside dining area in the back.

The bread, and dipping oil was phenomenal. Very fresh and you could tell that it was all homemade. The menu selection is giant, American fare with a combination of meal styles. Pork chops, steak, TONS of fish options ranging from Mahi Mahi to Sol (which is a difficult dish to find)

The prices were very reasonable. Low $20's for entrees, and I will tell you that the entrees are high quality. The Tuna was superb, and the wasabi mashed potatoes are something that I have never had but will talk about forever, because they were so unique and delicious!

If you're painting in cut off T shirts, you will feel welcome here. I like that about this place.

If you're planning a date night, this is a lovely spot.

All in all, if you want high quality food for a very reasonable price, with some friendly service, Luma may just be the place for you!",newamerican

The friendly server allowed us to eat out in the covered back patio where there was a nice breeze after some pouring rain.  Notes:

Server was actually from California and did acting before.  He was extremely nice and even offered to have our bread grilled since we liked our bread toasted.  

Appetizer was their homemade crab cake!  Probably the best crab cake I have ever had thus far!  Perfected cooked, fresh abundant amount of crab and just the right combination of flavor.  Have this if you visit.

The two dishes we had were also delicious.  The barramundi fish and the Asian steak flank did not disappoint!

We made reservations for my fiancé's birthday and were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated immediately. We started off with the hummus sampler and ordered the almond chicken and salmon for our meals. We absolutely loved everything! Our food was served hot and fresh and was so flavorful. We basically licked our plates clean - even the sauces were too good to be wasted. The service was phenomenal, as well. They truly went over and above and even brought out a birthday dessert that was a complete surprise!  This was our first time at Bistro 19, and we will for sure be back again! 

To add to the review above, my mom and stepdad stopped by Bistro 19 for lunch the following weekend. They, too, had a wonderful experience and could not stop raving about the food and service. In addition to the excellent service in the restaurant, my mom had been bummed out because they had accidentally left their leftovers on the table. My mom called shortly after to see if they were still there (again, the food is THAT good haha), and the owner went OVER AND ABOVE and actually dropped off a new order of food on their doorstep!

We had already eaten but then menu looked great. Next time, we'll stop for a bite.",newamerican
1404,4.0,2EhBiUnUTl_H2s4DXdKCTg,"An outstanding dinner with our road crew tonight. B19 took our short- notice reservation with the qualifier that we try to contain our meal to two hours due to a later group coming in. No problem...although interestingly, a credit card was requested ""in case we didn't show""...

When we got in, table had already been prepared and we were seated immediately. Table service was also immediate, menus were available and water was offered. This was a very nice menu including some beef, lamb, pork, chicken, and fish. There were even a couple of options available that made our vegan member quite happy.

The group ordered drinks, then our mains as well. I had the Chilean sea bass with the horseradish crust.  There was no argument when we requested substitutions - I chose grilled asparagus over the Napa slaw - and then we settled in and waited.

We're not a quiet group but the level of conversation and the ambiance in Bistro 19 worked well for us.  We may have been the least well dressed and quite possibly the aggregate youngest group in the restaurant but we were treated with a level of respect which appropriately reflected the professionalism of the wait staff.

Within a reasonable amount of time, our dinners were delivered.  Portions were adequate, and well-presented.  Always a bellwether for a restaurant, our pickiest eater admired, and then devoured her filet.  This is someone for whom a clean plate is foreign and, upon reflection, said that her steak was perfectly prepared and that the flavor of the toppings was ""exotic"".  Equally pleased was our group leader who wanted nothing more than the Bistro Burger.  He mentioned that it was one of the best burgers he'd had in a long while.  I certainly enjoyed my fish - the light but evenly cooked and seasoned crust was superb and the asparagus was very nicely prepared.  The macadamia rice was a bit of a let down, a bit dry and not overly flavorful but really didn't distract from the balance of the dish.

While desert was offered, we'd noticed a Grater's Ice Cream store down the road and chose to head over there rather than take B19 up on their offerings.  Maybe a pedestrian choice but we're a pretty generic group.

Total bill was $770 (including the aforementioned 20% gratuity).  Quite reasonable for a dozen diners, several drinks, and even a couple of bottles of a nice chardonnay. If we're ever back in the area, we'll be back.",newamerican
1405,4.0,2EhBiUnUTl_H2s4DXdKCTg,"I had dinner here last night with a friend before an event and it was a lovely experience! During the week, we got there at 5 and a reservation was definitely not necessary. I was promptly greeted by a friendly waiter who provided us with excellent service throughout the night. 

We each started with wine - a red for me and a white for her - and enjoyed the selections very much. I also had a nineteeni which was good, but not anything special. 

We started with the cheese plate and salmon sliders. I loved the cheese plate and the nice spread and selection of crackers, fruits and toppings. It included a cheddar, Swiss, and bleu cheese. The salmon sliders left me underwhelmed, lacking a punchy flavor. However, I did enjoy the paired sweet potato fries! 

We split the special for the evening - lobster ravioli. This was fabulous! A creamy sauce with lobster both in the sauce and in the pasta. 

We finished with the cookie skillet which is pretty much as good as it sounds and that's all there is to say about that :)

A great place if you're in Mt. Lebanon!",newamerican

Make reservations in advance! It's a small, intimate space. I called the day of and the first available for two people was around 8:15 (we got there by seven and luckily grabbed a seat at the bar instead of waiting until 8:15)

Bartenders were slammed, still managed to remain attentive on a Saturday evening.

It was my b day weekend so we went all out, our appetizer was a seasonal flatbread with figs... YUM.... amazing.... my entree was the scallops, which were Hot and full of flavor. My friend got friend he duck, it came with seasonal risotto and it was phenomenal!! For dessert we had both the pumpkin pie cheesecake, and banana foster. Foster looked pretty but the cheesecake was OUT OF THIS WORLD!

I will be coming back to bistro 19, ASAP... I also recommend this restaurant to anyone for any occasion. It's nice enough to be a ""nice night out"" but wouldn't say it's ""too nice"" to just stop by on a weeknight for no special occasion. Highly recommend!

The breakfast menu is straightforward. I typically get the same thing-1 egg, 3 strips of bacon, home fries, and toast. They use Mancini bread for the toast. YUM!!!!  They have other menu items like pancakes and waffles. I keep thinking I will order something different but I always order the usual. Bacon and eggs is a comfort food for me.

From the outside, you don't know what to expect- there aren't many windows on the outside. When you walk in, you will be surprised with how many tables the place has. It's definitely outdated in terms of the decor and furniture- but I kind of love the old school feel of the place. 

Their food isn't going to knock your socks off- but it's very good and VERY reasonably priced. My boyfriend and I have never had a $20 bill , it has always been under and we have always left full and happy. 

Fluffy pancakes, crispy bacon, thick toast, crispy home fries and omelettes that are packed to capacity-- their food never disappoints! Service is always awesome. And it has never been crowded when my boyfriend and I have come on the weekends (we are late comers though- eating breakfast around 12-1 usually).

Most customers were senior citizen regulars who ate and left pretty quickly.  I got the Pittsburgh omelet which had sausage, peppers and onions.  It was pretty good and tasty.  It was served with Mancini's bread (could have been toasted a little longer), and home fries (pretty average, but still tasty).  My partner got the hungry man which had a little bit of everything.  He said everything was cooked well and tasty.  Pancakes were nice and fluffy.   Definitely come here if you want the basics done right.  Nothing fancy or crazy creations.

Anyway, my son always wanted to try it here and we have lived literally a block down the road for almost 7 years yet this was our first visit this past Saturday morning. The only other time we have been here was when Mrs. Claus comes to the restaurant for the Brentwood Christmas festivities.

The service here is just great - very attentive and friendly. I don't have a thing bad to say - we didn't have to ask for anything, he brought us everything we needed. I just wish we came sooner. The breakfast that my son got was the funfetti pancakes with sausage patties ($3.99). I had the 2 egg combo with sausage patties, fried potatoes, and toast ($6.99). My son had a large glass of orange juice which was pretty big compared to other diners - I was surprised. The coffee was delicious as I tend to judge breakfast places based on their coffee and breakfast meats. The meals were made just right (and came out at the appropriate time maybe only 15 minutes after we ordered) with the perfect portions that leave you satisfied and not overstuffed.

The inside of the restaurant gives off a comfortable feel as if you are in your own dining room. There are a few tables to sit outside (and even water dishes for dogs!) - really cute home-y decor. I like the small tabletop trash cans for little trash items from sugar, milk, jelly etc - makes for a smooth cleanup for the staff.

All of their prices were very reasonable. We often frequent First Watch but this restaurant is probably the nicest little diner in our community and I look forward to many more visits as I prefer to support locally. We really enjoyed our breakfast and even my 7 year old said - ""this place is really cool.""",newamerican

We were a little disappointed in our visit here today. The food was just so-so, the portions were small, the order got mixed up, the potato ""pancakes"" were terrible and were fried in old grease, and the chicken tenders in my ""chicken or the egg"" breakfast did not taste or look in house home made breaded or battered like the menu said. More than one thing on the plate just looked like something frozen or generic I could buy in the freezer isle. On a positive note, our waitress was very friendly and the eggs were good, but everything else was underwhelming. For such a fantastic sounding menu, we were overall disappointed with the quality of what we were served.",newamerican
1414,4.0,mIVfDS47YwXjDjXVxAoZVg,"I'm always looking for a fresh breakfast/brunch spot especially in Pittsburgh. While bottomless mimosas are really my thing, places like this still get the job done even when I can't live my limitless mimosa dream. The area where Crack'd Egg is located is super cute and quaint. The street in Brentwood has a small town, old-fashioned vibe with hints of modern culture with the GameStop across the street. 

We went on a Sunday late morning, and the wait time was approximately 20 minutes for two. There was a bit of line. When you walk in, the space is much larger than it appears from the outside. We were seated just under 20 minutes in the middle of the dining room. The noise level is quite moderate. Be careful of the floor, I almost slipped twice wearing my booties. The decor and atmosphere carries a comfy and homey vibe which is refreshing especially on a Sunday morning. 

I ordered the Spiced Pumpkin Coffee off their seasonal menu; the homemade cream was excellent! I savored it for the entirety of my meal. The menu is unique with the names of meals. For example, I ordered the Olive Oyl which is simply a tomato, spinach, mozzarella and olive omelette. It was good and made traditionally. My partner ordered the Steak and Eggs which he admitted needed A1 sauce. He still enjoyed it even though the flavor was slightly lacking. 

Overall, we found the food delicious even if needed a little more flavor. The staff was busy but very hospitable and helpful. The space and location are charming. Give this place a try for breakfast one morning; I don't think you'll be disappointed.",newamerican
1415,1.0,mIVfDS47YwXjDjXVxAoZVg,"If I could give no stars I would. I tried this place because I read great reviews... well that must all be friends and family afraid to tell the truth. I can never in a million years understand what the buzz is about this cheap knock off of a first watch (which we have back where I am from). The servers look stressed out, yelling going on in the kitchen, the servers had more question about the menu than I did, the cook clearly can't cook an over easy egg. $9 for pancakes? Bacon over cooked and brittle, home fries had so much season salt/msg that they need a defibrillator on hand for heart attacks. Either they use fake egg or they don't know how to make scrambled eggs, so dry. Eggs should be moist and fluffy, not brown/green and sit in the window to let stand and taste like sand. Canned corn beef hash. And my friend ordered the ""fresh"" burger, which was freezer burnt. So what am I paying for? Nothing in there is fresh, so is it hoarding decorations or napkins I am paying for? I can see the burgers being bland at a breakfast place, but if you can't get the fundamentals down on breakfast maybe you shouldn't open a breakfast place up.  If you advertise fresh, don't have bread the only fresh item on the menu, which was the best part of the meal. They use a local bakery but they don't do them justice. 


P.s. to wait 30 minutes on a Sunday just to sit down and get this, your better off going to fast food chain buy breakfast and throw it out the window, ya'll will be more satisfied. I can promise you that.",newamerican

I knew it would be a good experience when our server just gave us four quarters for the parking meter and told us about the street behind the restaurant to park next time. 

The coffee was hot and not your typical water downed breakfast java.  It was bold and delicious.

They offer three different kinds of potatoes; cheesy, home fries and crispy potato pancakes. We had the latter two and they were both full of flavor.  

The toast options were more extensive than most as well.  An added bonus included in the jelly selection orange marmalade and apple butter... again outside of the norm.

I had the chicken and the egg. Two homemade chicken tenders smothered in a very yummy homemade gravy, two eggs (mine over medium for a little dippy action), home fries and two thick pieces of marble rye toast.

My daughter had the Eastwood which was a stuffed omelet with all kinds of goodness. 

My only lack of five stars was the price. For two of us with tip $30 for breakfast. A bit steep. But you pay for the ambience and the quality food.  Don't worry. I will be back!

Well done!!!


UPDATE   

I was here again a few times.  Since my first visit I have eliminated carbs for the most part, in my life.  I wanted an omelette but I did not care for the toast and potatoes (so many choices)!

We have discussed coming here for our anniversary for a few years now and we finally made reservations for it this year.  We pulled up to the restaurant to use their valet.  They share it with BRGR and its through Pittsburgh valet.  It was only $3 which was nice but he was busy and the only guy working.  It took about ten minutes to get parked but still worth it I think.  

We were seated right away.  We had glanced over the menu before so we knew what we wanted.  I ordered a Malbec for my drink.  We shared a Tuna Poke for our appetizer and I order the hanger steak for my entrée.

I thought the tuna Poke was really good.  It was a great start to the meal and very flavorful.  I recommend trying it.  My wine was really good too.  I like Malbec and it goes good with steak.  My hanger teak was slightly better than average in my opinion.  It was presented well and dressed very nicely with vegetables but it just wasn't near the steak I was thinking I would get.  It was lacking in flavor and a little tough.  I don't want to make it sound like it was a bad steak because it wasn't.   I ate all of it and enjoyed the steak but I was just expecting better from Spoon.

Start to finish the food was just meeting the standard of OK. I cook myself and enjoy the culinary arts, but I am absolutely a novice when it comes to putting a dish together, however I seriously question some of the choices that the person who put the menu together made. Blue cheese soufflé (fine.. but no crackers/bread to eat it with)? Sunflower seeds on a chocolate cake? 

The mains were fine, but the selection wasn't great. Not a single thing on the menu stood out to me. I am not a picky eater so I can usually find something that grabs me after a quick peek, but I labored over the menu and still could not find something so I just went with the steak. This could probably be fixed by changing the descriptions because the mains weren't terrible.

The best thing about this dinner was the drinks. Waitress was nice and attentive, though she did not seem practiced/prepared. Listed as a date on open table, but received seating near the cashier (and we were there before anyone else).

We then moved on to the appetizers, we had the tuna poke, blue cheese souffle, and the tuscano tomatoes.  The tuna poke was good; the watermelon looked very similar to the tuna and was an interesting surprise.

For me, Carmody Grille has been a stop for before or after skating.

The food here I think is just a touch pricey for what it is, but everything I've had here is very good.

On my most recent visit, my friend and I split the deep fried pickles and we both ordered the steak salad. The meat was excellent (sometimes restaurants use Steakems but this was legit steak) and perfectly cooked medium (as requested, since sometimes restaurants overcook the meat).

Our deep fried pickles were tasty, but with the breading being a little crumbly, I think the fryer could've been a little hotter before they were cooked. The seasoning on them was spot on though.

Also, our waiter seemed to be annoyed with serving us, even though there were only a couple other customers around when we were there. My friend asked for a different drink when her iced tea tasted overbrewed, which I didn't think was unreasonable, but that seemed to set our waiter off. Oh well.",newamerican

Very friendly staff, nice bathrooms, nice contemporary decor and the food is great too. It's one of the few places you can get turtle soup! The fried zucchini is excellent. I could make a whole meal of just that. I did try the power slaw and wasn't thrilled but it's not them, it's me because no matter how much I try, I can't like kale in any form. My bad. I had the hot sausage sandwich and it was perfect. I like the fact that it's a patty, and not the usual sausage shape which always manages to slip out of the other side of the bun - smart move! The only thing that would make me happier than I already am, is please offer the sauerkraut balls appetizer that was at the old place. They would be a hit, I'll bet!",newamerican
1427,4.0,l1JDX-o0wCLykuh78R8Kng,"We were asked if we had reservations. The restaurant had only 5 tables seated, but was otherwise empty. This morning was teetering on a hard pass, our waitress took almost 30 minutes to take our order and kept making separate trips she deemed necessary. But the support staff for our dismissive waitress made a good impression. The food is not much and pricey, but what you do get is tasty. Plus the Americanos we received were very good. 

Fast forward to dinner tonight, there was a downpour and a flash flood warning on the 4th of July. This was open and super crowded and the vibe was so much better. Shawn was the only waiter and was fantastic! He made us feel like we were the only customers that mattered, he made everyone feel that way. The chefs amuse was tasty, as were our light dinners. It was light and refreshing and we enjoyed our beers and even got the olive oil chocolate cake to go.",newamerican
1428,2.0,l1JDX-o0wCLykuh78R8Kng,"Came on a Sunday evening with a reservation. Waited for about 20 minutes past our reservation time but were excited to eat here and not in a rush. We have been to the bar several times and had great drinks and snacks and were very pleased. We have also had the catered version of their food at a wedding at the hotel. We expected the same quality and service In the restaurant. HOWEVER, we will probably not return.  The dining ""space"" is casual and unique but for spending over $200 for 2 on dinner I personally would like a more formal atmosphere. 
They had NO steak. 
They were out of steak and explained it was because it was a Sunday evening. We had to order from the entree menu of only 4 choices. I understand with a fresh menu and farm to table items run out but ALL of the steak? I had the wedge salad which only had lettuce and blue cheese. There were minuscule pork belly pieces on the side which was was the best part. We had the bone marrow which was no where near the delicious Marrow we have had at other locations like meat and potatoes or butcher and the rye. The bread served with it was soooo buttery it was hard to stomach adding the rich marrow. Since where were no steaks (which we came for) we had the chicken and the duck. It was just so sub par and over priced they were not creative and my duck was partially hot and partially ice cold. There are also about only 7 wines you get by the glass and the staff had no idea what to recommend (unlike the bar staff) We wanted scotch and there was no list. We had to name different types and ask if they had it while the waiter went to the bar multiple times to find out.  All in all I jsut don't get the hype. I have had their steak at a wedding and it was fantastic. So perhaps if available this would be a different review. I felt let down knowing I could have worn sweats and easily spent over $200. You can't also hear the music blasting from the lobby",newamerican
1429,3.0,l1JDX-o0wCLykuh78R8Kng,"Came in on a Monday evening for dessert and a night cap. Here is the TLDR version....

-Bar dude with the painted nails was super rude, seemed mad at me for being a customer. 
-Ordered a Jim Beam on the rocks, coffee for my husband. Asked for a dessert menu. 
-After 15 mins of waiting for them to take my dessert menu, I flagged man down and ordered peach pie NO ICE CREAM. Asked to cash out after that.
-Got charged for the peach pie but not the drinks. seriously?
-now I have a separate tab for the whiskey and coffee. I'll close that tab. -I went to sign the receipt and I noticed the price was high.... Itemized receipt showed he charged me for an Old Fashioned instead of whiskey on rocks (DOUBLE the price of my whiskey).... 
-Pie came...... HARD AS A ROCK, ROOM TEMP, WITH ICE CREAM... It was like a hockey puck, shape and hardness. Wtf man could this be any worse??? I tried to cut a piece with my fork and the pie almost flew across the room b/c it was so hard. I asked for a box and took it home. 

One of my worst experiences at any establishment in Pittsburgh. 3 stars is for the $6 Jim Beam. ugh I hate writing this because I just want to forget about it, but let it be known that the service is horrendous.",newamerican

Delicious food though.,newamerican

I went here with a large group, about 12 and they were able to accommodate us (we had a reservation.) They have a full service coffee bar which is a big plus for a brunch/breakfast place. I ordered a delicious, strong americano. I ordered a simple bacon and eggs breakfast which was prepared perfectly.",newamerican
1432,4.0,IKA-wA459qPdRh7Bgl90ow,"Stopped by here for lunch after visiting some family in the area.  We wanted something semi kid friendly and hopefully with some parking.  Check and check. Next up, something with craft beers and a good menu. Check and check. 

So we kind of sat ourselves. Since we had two little ones, we wanted to have some room. They have this open concept kitchen where we see some of the dishes being finished off.  There were two waitresses that day and they could've used one more.  However both were great and helpful. The kids were almost in meltdown mode and had some chicken fingers and fries.  The fries were very good. The chicken was ok, the kids did like it.

I ordered their buffalo burger (with the buffalo sauce) and it was excellent. Again the fries were awesome.  The table also got some grilled wings with dry seasoning and let me tell you, it's must. 

The beer list is impressive for sure, something for everybody.  They also had some bad ass cocktails... maybe next time.",newamerican
1433,4.0,IKA-wA459qPdRh7Bgl90ow,"I really do like this place especially for Taco Tuesday. The staff is always really friendly and the food is always stellar. This was the very first time that I came and it was super busy. The main parking lot was full but they have additional parking in the rear of the restaurant. Even though the place was packed, I was greeted by a host and was directed to the bar as requested. Our bartender was really fun and knowledgeable of the menu and draft list. Our food took a little longer than usual but that was expected considering how busy they were.

The only negative I had was that the place kind of smelled like old mop when you walked in which eventually subsided or I got used to it.

Besides that, the 3 for $10 dollar tacos were worth it!",newamerican

The second visit was for their Monday wing night. They rocked! Half off wings are a great way to end a Monday.

We sat on one side of the horseshoe-shaped dining area to watch the TV. In the middle is the bar, grill, and food-prep counter, with big glass windows all around. We enjoyed grilled ribs (sriracha maple syrup bacon and garlic parmesan) and split a house salad for a small but delicious lunch. There were lots of good-looking options on the menu, including the burgers and a number of sides. Despite the loud music, this would probably be a nice place to come back and try other dishes. They don't seem to be able to handle groups larger than four, and the restrooms are single stalls and gendered. Ample free lot parking.",newamerican

The food was incredible, the drinks were creative and delicious (do yourself a favor, order off of the signature cocktails menu), but the service was what put it into a different category.  Every person I interacted with was knowledgable, flexible, and incredibly friendly, especially Paul behind the bar who set the tone at making me feel welcome from the moment I walked in.

My only regret is that coming from out of town itll be a while before I can make it back, but this is the sort if place that will be firmly on my list for any time I'm back in Pittsburgh.  Awesome job, guys :)",newamerican
1438,4.0,9YhEuxUPnqadrG58ewa2Dg,"As others had mentioned, expectations are high for Fish Nor Fowl. Mostly based on their aesthetic Instagram posts.

Surprisingly, there's not much fish! I was impressed with the amount of vegetarian options though. We were doing a little restaurant hop for my birthday, so we weren't ordering super heavy here. 

We went with the calamari appetizer (special) and one of the pasta dishes which also had seafood in it. Both weren't huge portions, but were very delicious. 

The drink that my boyfriend ordered from the bar definitely wasn't his cup of tea, but they seem to have a nice variety of signature cocktails to choose from. I played it safe and ordered a glass of wine. 

The space is lovely, including the infamous plant wall. Tons of seating inside, shared or very close to mostly. We choose to sit at the window, which opens up on warmer days and nights.

Please note that all other staff were friendly, it was just this one person. (Also my wine was a super short pour and the general feeling I got was that the restaurant wasn't quite comfortable in its skin.)

1440,3.0,9YhEuxUPnqadrG58ewa2Dg,"Had high expectations but was really disappointed.
The hostess and the waitress looked very ""mad"". The waitress sounded very judgmental when taking our order. Attitudes are a huge part in the hospitality industry and our experience here was extremely low. 
We sat on the second floor and it was relatively quiet but the environment on the first floor was more open and lively. The ceiling on the second floor was also lower than normal and it gives you a depressing feeling. 
The food in general was alright. Was disappointed with the foie gras and steak. I highly recommend their caviar and halibut collar. Otherwise there wasn't anything that really amazed us. And it took a long time for them to bring the drinks/food and especially the check. 
The interior decorations had a theme but lowkey inconsistent. It feels like the designer couldn't decide what he or she wants or there was a lot of conflicts and arguments between the designer and owner so they reached a suboptimal choice lol. The pillows are actually spikey, so it hurts your skin on the back.",newamerican

The Chicken Cacciatore was very flavorful and the Calamari was a unique and creative with a different flavor profile than normal calamari, it was served with a aioli and Mandarin oranges which gave it a fresh take on the dish.

1442,4.0,qNSZpcyoF7OM6g49sAFUcQ,"I wasn't expecting anything special given the quality of reviews here, but I was pleasantly surprised! It's not anything gourmet, but my sister and I had a very pleasant time having dinner here. 

It was a nice cool evening when we came so we decided to sit at one of the outside tables - a very cute little area to sit and chat, and the tables aren't too close together for comfort. Bakery Square is pretty adorable, with kids nearby playing ping pong and people enjoying the patio with their dogs. 

I ordered the classic pierogies for a starter; this was the least impressive part of my meal. I'm from Buffalo, so I was interested to compare the pierogies here to those at home, with both cities having such significant Polish populations. Unfortunately based on this sample, Buffalo definitely wins - these were decently tasty, but more or less had the quality of something that you could get out of a box in the freezer section of the grocery store (still though, how much can you really mess up dough filled with potatoes and cheese!). Also were way too drenched in butter, to the point of leaving our lips feeling greasy.

I'm pleased to report that the entrees went over much better. I had a Reuben sandwich, which was delicious. Really loaded up with corned beef, and the flavors of the meat, kraut, and sauce melded in a really pleasant and tangy way. The French fries were also above average quality, for this type of casual restaurant. My sister was similarly pleased with her Buffalo chicken sandwich. 

Overall, would be happy to return here on my next visit to Pittsburgh, and could see myself hanging out here often with friends due to the casual, low key atmosphere and solid quality of the food at a decent price.",newamerican
1443,3.0,qNSZpcyoF7OM6g49sAFUcQ,"Not disappointing but not fantastic. The service at the table was descent although the welcoming was off-putting. It was a Saturday night (during a Steelers home game weekend) and the hostess was very frantic & complained about the rush. I understand being overwhelmed but the manner in which she expressed frustration was too far way & unprofessional. 

The turkey burger was cooked well; however, the ratio of burger to cheese is way off, leaving the burger fairly dry.

The chicken dip and beer cheese are great appetizers, although don't get both because it ended up feeling too heavy to have both. The pita chips are served warm & soft.",newamerican
1444,3.0,qNSZpcyoF7OM6g49sAFUcQ,"TL/DR : Social is : a GREAT place for groups, a great place for a drink, and a good place for food after said drink. But it's not .... the best .... if you are there to have a meal that is quality in a quiet or even medium noise level space. If you are allergic to dogs sit inside! They DO allow dogs on their porch which is awesome  It's a good place to watch the game with friends and just an all around welcoming place that could use some tweaks on the front end of service 

I deducted two stars due to quality of food and service. 

Social, it's a place I walk by or ride by nearly everyday. And yet it took me months to get there. My date and I chose this place because it was convenient. It was trivia night (Monday night!) so not to knock trivia but we wanted to sit outside to avoid the noise. Trivia night is pretty loud. 

When we asked for outdoor seating they were accommodating, until I asked to be seated fully under the covering; and the hostess wanted to know why. I had to quickly make a reason up, that she found sufficient, so we could be moved. 

The noise outside wasn't much better. And legit everyone had a dog. I'm a HUGE dog lover; but if you are afraid of dogs or allergic this might not be the place for you (outside at least! ). 

So right now I'm taking one star away -- for the hostess experience -- it wasn't accommodating and I felt unnerved that they asked why we wanted to switch to a table that wasn't in the sun. 

Onto the food. The fries are good! Really good. Get those. I had the veggie burger and it was cold / tasted like it had maybe come from an expensive box. It was dry and if I wasn't really hungry I wouldn't have eaten it at all. My date had the turkey club and he couldn't eat it. I had to take a star off for food quality.

Our server was nice but it took forever to get the check.

The bill for drinks, apps, and two dinners was only $35! as well . look forward to going back; but not on trivia night and I won't get that veggie burger again haha!",newamerican
1445,4.0,qNSZpcyoF7OM6g49sAFUcQ,"Social has AMAZING food! It far surpassed my expectations for bar food. I highly recommend the buffalo pierogis, the grilled chicken sandwich, and the tator tots. All were served piping hot and had their own unique twists. Social also has more beer choices than you could dream of, at what I'd consider to be affordable prices. There are many TVs to watch the games, as well as corn hole, foosball, and ping pong tables outside. The only downfall to Social is the service. Whether we had sat at a table outside or right at the bar, we've always had to call the server or bartender over to wait on us. Other than the service, the food and drinks are great, and it is definitely worth stopping by in Bakery Square!",newamerican

To say the least, everything was extremely bland and honestly mediocre. We personally were not a fan of the Mac and Beer Cheese. The Buffalo Chicken Pizza tasted extremely bland - I totally wasn't expecting this because it looked so good!! Our favorite item we tried were the Pretzels (we decided to get them with beer cheese instead of mustard). Again, the pretzels were pretty basic with nothing special to them. Our favorite part was the beer cheese dip, which was the only item that really stood out to us. 

I probably would've given this place 2 stars based strictly on the food, but thanks to the lively and fun atmosphere it receives 3 stars from me!

If I decide to come here again, it'll probably just be to grab a drink and enjoy the atmosphere.",newamerican

1449,2.0,wkP_fSZ5w6S9ZQaAFSQ9rg,"Visited Atria's for a pharmacy organization dinner recently and was excited to try it out - being from PGH (specifically the South Hills), I've always heard about Atria's but have never visited. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in my experience.

We were in the upstairs private room, which itself was lovely - a lot of natural light, but the space was a tiny bit crammed for all of us. The stairs getting up to the room were very narrow, which isn't a problem for 24-year-old me, but may be an issue for older folk. We mingled a little bit and had a small intro for our ""program"" for the night before eating, but then when we did start to settle in, the waitstaff was absent nearly the entire night. My dad brought a bottle of wine for our family to share (corkage fee $10), but it was very difficult to get the attention of any of the servers to bring us glasses and open our bottle for us - it wasn't until we had our main course in front of us and were starting to eat that we had the bottle opened and poured. In terms of food, it is hard to truly evaluate since we had a buffet for dinner - never truly as good as ordering off the menu. The salad was one of the highlights - full of fresh red onion, tomatoes, and cucumbers with the option to throw on egg and bacon as well. The buffet included penne pasta with marinara sauce, which was overly sweet and lacked a little bit of cheese on it - the dish was also not kept hot, making it less desirable as well. Roasted veggies were the highlight of the hot foods, consisting of a nice combination of zucchini, yellow squash, red peppers, and red onion with a simple yet flavorful spice profile (likely just S&P, but very tasty) - I loaded up on these. Lastly for me, I had the grilled chicken, which was pretty standard - one piece of mine was a little dry, but other than that, nothing too much to write home about, just a standard chicken breast. There were also ""smashed"" potatoes on the buffet, which I did not try but heard were OK as well. After dinner, we had requested some coffee to accompany our dessert, and the waitstaff seemed a little confused - they brought out a few cups, but then wound up setting up a coffee station for us all to enjoy. This was a great gesture, but the regular coffee ran out almost instantaneously and was not replenished for the night :( For dessert, we had a tray of assorted mini treats, including petit fours, mini cheesecake bites, and chocolate chip cookies. I had one mini cheesecake with choco chips on it and one plain one, which were both tasty, but again (and this was the theme of the night), nothing overly exciting and honestly tasted like some of the mini desserts you can get at Costco or Sam's Club. 

At the end of the day, my experience at the OG Atria's was a little sad. I will give the caveat that experiences with a group of people and with a buffet are hard to extrapolate to the actual dining experience, so I would be interested to order off their menu to get a better idea of the restaurant's offerings and service. However, wouldn't make visiting Atria's again a high priority during my next visit to PGH.",newamerican

The decor is unassuming and unpretentious and the food is absolutely divine. Yes, expensive, but a must visit if you have the chance. Chef David has a masterful grasp of fine dining using ingredients, garden grown parts of plants I'd never heard of to create visually striking dishes that taste just as good as they look.

1456,4.0,vZSgu1k5gWkTmoMwmmKc9Q,"I want to give this place another chance. The exterior is absolutely stunning. The interior is equally impressive. 

The restaurant is hyper-local and doesn't even provide lemons with water. Something I was a little appalled by but later after some thought, admired. 

I could tell that the restaurant was still trying to find its groove though. There was only one server in the restaurant who catered to all the guests. Service was a little slow because of this. For a 6 course meal, my two friends and I were at the restaurant for 3.5 hours and left.. still hungry. 

I appreciate all the small touches the chef included in the meal such as a welcoming cocktail which was a very tasty, delicate cider. The first dish was roasted sunchokes, topped with fancy salt and black truffle. The sunchokes were cooked to perfection with a very buttery taste and texture. The salt complimented the dish wonderfully. This dish was very unique with exquisite taste however, simple. 

Next was a fancy clam chowder. It was great! The clams were very plump and juicy. The soup itself was very buttery. The dish was delicious but nothing out of the ordinary. The third course was a soup with gooseberries, chives, grains and carrots from the chef's garden. This might have been the best dish I had. The dish had different textures that were great and delicious. I was super happy eating this because I also felt healthy. Every bite was a treat. The gooseberries' sweetness mixed with the buttery salty goodness of the broth and oats. This was the best dish; this was the only exceptional dish to me.. all the others were good. 

The last savory dish was venison loin with honey poached cranberries. This dish was tasty and the meat was cooked perfectly, it was super juicy and blended well with the sauce. The meat was salty but blended well with the sweet tartness of the sauce. 

The dessert was apples with cultured cream and blueberry jam. This was super tasty, but just a fancy yogurt. 
The last course was a little taste of honey. I was a little shocked that a spoonful of honey would be considered a course. The meal concluded with a cute little take home gift of camomile tea and a stick of the featured honey. 

Would I come here again? Absolutely after some time. I'd like to give this restaurant a little more time to operate and find its bearings before I return. The food was delicious and executed beautifully. However, the service and portions were slightly off for me.

1459,4.0,cdX8lf5BsJjpC82dzgtBZA,"What a nice surprise! Our first visit to Bar 3 was to hear an acoustic set on Friday night. I had looked at the menu in advance, and thought it looked promising - a variety of selections somewhat elevated from typical bar food, and some healthy choices as well. As we had already eaten dinner, we opted for a less healthy spinach dip, but it was tasty!

The beer selection was very good, too, with a variety of beers, not just IPAs or Miller Lites.  We saw that they had the Lambic Framboise and the bartender was happy to mix it with some Hoegarden, to allow us to share (try it if you haven't done so - really a nice combination).  

Service and the overall ambience of the bar were also a step well above average. This makes Bar 3 competitive with nearby brew pubs, which are fun, but often overcrowded. I would recommend for anyone who might be planning to see a show at Mr. Smalls, etc., as a nice pre-/post- stop.",newamerican
1460,3.0,cdX8lf5BsJjpC82dzgtBZA,"We stopped in here recently with a group of about 15.  I am sure they were overwhelmed, as there was no one in the bar when we arrived.  I will say the atmosphere was really nice inside.  Everything looks new and clean and made for a good drinking spot.  The food kind of fell flat however.

We ordered the pretzels and beer cheese as an appetizer.  They were decent, nothing special.  For my meal I went with the buffalo chicken sandwich.  This was a really average sandwich.  The menu said the chicken was breaded, but it was not a thick enough batter.  The chicken itself was definitely not crispy.  This caused the buffalo sauce the make the sandwich a little sloppy.  The buffalo sauce itself did not have a very good flavor and had no spice to it at all.  The ranch dressing they had also had a strange taste to it.  It seemed house made, but it just tasted off.",newamerican

Inside it is very modern, with an abundance of tv's and an upstairs seemingly for larger parties. We came down on a Friday night, before a session at LumberjAxes, and the food was excellent. I had a burger and fries, while my wife had a chicken sandwich. 

Overall, the food was great and the atmosphere was nice and modern.",newamerican

I've eaten at the Chinese food place and Au Bon Pain; typical fare.",newamerican

The restaurant offerings in the food court include AuBon Pain, Cheesesteak Charley's, Flamers, and Chinese food. If you want something a little sweet duck into the Hallmark store and grab some Sarris. There is also Katie's Kandy on the 1st floor. It has tons of different candy that you purchase by the pound. If you need a caffeine fix there is a great coffee shop located under the escalator. (Sounds weird, but trust me).",newamerican

Totally not worth the convenience of eating in the same hotel one stays in.",newamerican

Located in the otherwise abysmal Pittsburgh Grand Wyndham, I was charmed by this hidden gem. The prices are on the high side for Pittsburg, but I did not feel robbed. There are better bars and restaurants in and around Pittsburgh, but if you are stuck in hotel this place is a great option. The service is efficient without all the niceties of more refined places. The decor is typical of the hotel bar genre. Solid three stars.",newamerican
1468,3.0,SzOHx8dtluzZe3kxkYkJCA,"This place was decent, but pricey. I had the omelette with bacon, sausage, and bell peppers. You can choose 3 ingrediants to put in your omelette and any addition costs a buck more. It comes with tasted baked potato wedges and your choice of bread. I have to say the bread was great. The overall dish was great. The only reason for the 3 stars was because of the customer service. They were not very attentive to the customers. Maybe its because it is part of the hotel? Maybe they were serving room service ahead of me? I wasnt too sure but wanted to give them some benefit of the doubt. 

Besides that, the omelette was fresh hot and was cooked well. If it wasnt for the price and service, this place can easily get a four star. It was also morning, so maybe the staff was just tired? Either or, if you have money, its a decent place to try. Be prepared to wait a bit.",newamerican

I was thoroughly impressed with the hostess for asking.  She was friendly, lively and Pittsburgh welcoming!

1470,3.0,EHGKrUgGpxYpfs4N3paJ1w,"Staying at the Westin for the week. Asked the front desk for a local restaurant to have breakfast. They suggested we stay at the hotel and try the Penn City Grill. My first reaction was way is this place empty at 8 am did we miss the breakfast rush. We were two of 10 guests having breakfast.

The waiter was very animated I assumed was an aspiring actor. He offered us coffee and juices. The coffee was Starbucks. $4.50 and they leave the pot, about 4 cups. The juice was also $4.50 and they do refill. 

Breakfast choices were non traditional. There is plenty of healthy choices for those that are healthier then most. However if your looking for a traditional breakfast you will need to go elsewhere. We ordered the ham and eggs. Poached eggs that were hardly poached. $15.00 for two eggs with ham and toast with a small portion of home fries. Tomorrow we go in town looking for a diner",newamerican
1471,3.0,EHGKrUgGpxYpfs4N3paJ1w,"I have mixed feelings about Penn City Grill. I came in for breakfast expecting speedy service given the low volume of customers. While service was initially fast, it quickly deteriorated. After placing my order, my waitress then forgot my order and had to walk back to my table to ask for my order again. Additionally, it took quite a while for them to get my check to me after I had finished eating. 

The food, though, was pretty good. I had the BLT Benedict and was pleasantly surprised by the sweetened English muffin; the sweet taste contrasted nicely with the bacon and gave a refreshing twist to the traditional Benedict recipe.",newamerican

I got a small sandwich,  a little portion of hash browns, and coffee for $19.50. My wife got a bagel, hash browns, and coffee for $13.50. The BLT sandwich was okay at best.

1474,2.0,EHGKrUgGpxYpfs4N3paJ1w,"So I have a theory. The architects at the Westin really wanted to build an obstacle course as part of the hotel. And so they did. But then they couldn't figure out how to market it. So they decided to turn that obstacle course into a restaurant instead, and they called it the Penn City Grill.

Now, the food isn't too bad, and the sushi is decent. But the service is so slow and so inefficient at the Penn City Grill, that it's almost comical to watch the waitstaff run back and forth, without any rhyme or reason, because anything you ask for -- menu, silverware, napkins, check -- requires at minimum two laps around the obstacle course.

So eventually, I stopped expecting the waitstaff to come around, and just enjoyed the show. Never mind that the restaurant is at most 25% full. Stuff just takes that long.

Bravo, Penn City Grill! If that's the goal you were aiming for, you certainly succeeded.",newamerican

The only big con I have is that my roasted chicken felt like that dish where they have it so they can say they have a chicken dish.  It was a bit uninspired, even with the broth flavors.  The Spinach and Garlic dumplings were amazing, but I have to agree with others who have said its whelming.  

I tried some of my partner's Mediterranean Socca Tart which was excellent and she raved about her bite of her mom's trout.  Her dad (her parents were in town visiting) got a special pasta dish that was special that night.  He liked it quite a bit and it drew good comments from us too. 

It was our appetizers--we shared the Crispy Pork Belly, Heirloom Carrot Salad, Homemade pretzels and the Roasted Spiced Cauliflower--though that drew rave reviews.  The pretzels were hot and fresh and the mustard was amazing and the crispy pork belly also got high marks from us. Honestly, all them were incredible.

We tried every single appetizer and mid-course except salads. Some of my party members weren't sure about a certain herbacious je ne sais quoi of the crab dip. I personally though it was fantastic.

I would say that some of the dishes were risky. The shrimp ceviche had good flavor but was quite sparse.

Overall the food we had good was good in flavor, adventurous, and interesting. The sweetbreads were my favorite dish--exciting but also warm and comforting.

Phenomenal cocktails, excellent small beer selection, and great bubbles. Drink prices were perfect.

Fried olives were what you'd expect, but I would have liked a sauce of some type to cut through the saltiness. I would recommend they elevate that dish with a side of warm pepper jelly or a hot honey perhaps. We also got the Mac and cheese fritters which were, again, what you would expect.

We ordered our drinks and a few appetizers (popcorn and the chips and dip) and were going to decide on what else to order, as we had tickets to a show and needed to leave within a two hour window. 

We got our wine in an o.k. amount of time, but it was a little longer than you would expect for no mixing or crafting being involved. The popcorn and chips took well over 45 minutes to get to the table. They were both honestly really good, but I just don't know why or how it could take that long for those two items. We asked out server if we would have time to order one more appetizer, because we had to leave at 7:30 and she assured us it would be fine. We ordered the fried mac and cheese and honestly waited another 20 minutes. We needed to wait for silverware and then had to ask someone else for our check so we could pay quickly and leave.

The second time was disappointing, though. We got the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup. Despite the menu saying that it was cheddar cheese, what we got was surely a slice of white American cheese on Italian bread. You know, the kind of stuff that you peel out of its individual plastic wrapper. The soup could have been Campbell's, but with a dash of olive oil and herbs on top. All for $12. 

Looking at another table, I saw the chips and guacamole orders, where customers were dipping the slightest amount onto each chip so that they wouldn't run out. The amount that they got was TINY. 

The happy hour old fashioneds were quite tasty. But not very generous, at $8 for HAPPY HOUR. 

I'll probably be back.  The place is nice. But for the price point, they're a bit off the mark. I can handle $12 for soup and grilled cheese. Just make me think that it's worth it. Not with processed cheese and warm tomato juice. 

The menu was quite different between the first and second visits. So maybe they're still experimenting, since they're pretty new. If so, axe the grilled cheese and bring back the scallop dumplings!",newamerican

The autumnal fields drink I ordered was much too sweet and came on an unnecessary slice of wood with a leaf on it. The old fashion I had bizarrely had several ice cubes in it rather than one large cube, which made drinking it tough.

We were sat immediately in the adorable dining room. Johnny Cash played on the radio. We met out server and he helped us pick out our dishes. 

Matt and I decided to split the breakfast poutine (ten out of ten), and it was an excellent decision.  Mounds of duckfat fries and sausage gravy, crispy pork belly, and curds. Wow, I'm pretty sure they found the cure for the common hangover. This stuff sticks to your bones. It's delicious. 

I decided on the breakfast bowl, and Matt got the brunch burger. At this point; I'm pretty much stuffed, but I persevere and eat about 98% of the grits, pork, and biscuit.

The biggest flop of the night I'll get to at the end.  I'll try to review only the food/service experience, which, without anything else, would probably jack up the review by another star, but not two.

The food was good.  The poutine was delicious, but not something I'd go back to order.  My meal (Yellowfin with Shrimp and Scallop:  olive oil crushed potato with garlic rouille, petite nicoise vegetables, black oilve vinaigrette) was...a single shrimp on a dollop of mashed potato, a single scallop on a dollop of mashed potato, and a piece of yellowfin on a dollop of mashed potato.  It was fine.  Aggressively so.  I don't even mind about the portion size, because I'd had a drink (it was good!) and shared the poutine, which is generous.  But fine is not five-star despite how alliterative that would be.  

The waitress communicated most things well to us.  Our food came pretty quickly and she was attentive. 

My wife got the Panisse, which just seemed more like an answer to the question, ""Why don't people make french fries out of chick peas"" than anything else, and a hamburger, which she said was good.

The couple dining with us had the Cavatelli of chicken and Duo of pork.  And both of their dishes seemed fine.  Or so I assume since they ate them.  

The food was average to above average.  The wait staff (bartender) was nice.  Lots of vegan options, which is a nice option of Pittsburghers.  

The restaurant...was FREEZING.  Nobody said a thing.  No apologies or acknowledgements.  Literally every patron was wearing a coat.  One woman seated at the table we ended up taking later was wearing a stocking cap.  

When the waitress seated us I asked for the warmest table in the place...she chuckled and seated us next to two space heaters.  

This was not...""have the thermostat set too low because the kitchen is so hot"" cold.  

This was not...""saving energy (hi mom and dad)"" cold.

This was...""Didn't pay the gas bill so they turned it off"" cold.  

Thank GOD we were there on a 50 degree night.  The space heaters boosted it up to a solid 55 or maybe even 60 inside.  

As I said, nobody mentioned the temperature.  We didn't do ourselves the service of asking.  But it was not normal.  

While I assume this was some sort of weird growing pain kind of glitch, I'd have to go back again to see and...it just wasn't good enough for me to want a repeat visit.",newamerican
1502,5.0,1dHCtT1rb9Q1jcmYTg8OSw,"It's opening day at Supper's new location and I was looking forward to trying it out. Supper began as a concept restaurant at Federal Galley almost two years back and late spring of this year moved out to establish their own restaurant.

At the helm are Chef Vince and his wife Candace along with a bartender and wait staff. Candace took the time to explain the concept to me. Supper on Penn makes everything from scratch and does not use any processed foods. It is designed to meet the needs of those who are gluten free, vegetarian, vegan, and regular food so that a group of people can sit at a table and enjoy a meal that has something for everyone.

The menu is clearly marked accordingly. The place is small and very clean. Off to the entrance they have a full service bar. At this point they have a limited selection of non alcoholic beverages but that will change as they get settled in. Candace explained to me that the menu will change with the seasons and what was being served today was from their summer menu.

Since vegan places are limited in the Pittsburgh area I decided instead of a hamburger to have the meat free alternative. With it you get a choice of duck fries, salad, or chick pea fries. After speaking with Chef Vince I went with the chickpea fries. I asked him what does he use in preparing a vegan burger. He told me he uses protein based ingredients including quinoa and chick peas and builds from there. 

It took a while to get my food but remembering that it is being made from scratch and cooked to perfection resulted in a very filling and delicious lunch. My vegan burger was made with cheese substitute and sat on an enormous pretzel bun. The chickpeas fries were thick and came with a dipping sauce. Take out is also available as well as containers since you get so much in a meal. I was literally full when I was only halfway done with my sandwich! 

I got the opportunity to chat with some others who visited and learned the falafel pita is one of their most popular offerings. If a sandwich is too much for you then you can order small bites such as seared scallop or stuffed smoked tomato which is their version of a vegan meatball. Gluten free bread is also available for sandwiches. Everyone I had spoken to were pleased with their selections.

The desserts sounding tempting but will have to wait for next time. Among their offerings are vegan plum cheesecake and two regular cakes. They make their own ice cream using liquid nitrogen to ""fast freeze"" the elements. Chef Vince's specialty is the peanut butter flavored both for vegans and non vegans alike. Using coconut milk for vegans a person can order 3 scoops of different flavors.

They serve the lunch/dinner menu everyday except Sunday when they do brunch. Candace also told me that given time they plan to incorporate a breakfast menu. 

The building itself has a history of its own and they've taken the time to renovate it based on its industrial roots. With Edison lights hanging from the tin ceiling to lanterns illuminating each tables one is taken back to the speakeasy days of the early 1900s.

Supper on Penn is located in the 1200 block of Penn Ave just as you have entered the Strip district. It sits near the bus depot and not far from the Heinz history center.

Delicious food; hubby had the Pittsburgh Pierogies (when in Rome), and I enjoyed the West Coast Vegan, shared the spicy tater tots. Everything hit the spot.

With several tables open, I had 10 people ready to sit at a large table by the bar (which are usually first come first serve since it's a bar table).  The hostess (who also said she was the manager) informed me that there was a multi hour wait.  There was nobody outside waiting and nobody inside around me waiting.  After arguing with me for several minutes when I informed her that I had 10 people ready to spend hundreds of dollars on food and drinks she told me, ""That's not how the world works.""

Once seated, we waited so long to put in our drink orders that we were all able to decide on entrees. We ordered everything at once. Everyone got there drinks, except for me. I had to ask for my beer, in a bottle, the easiest drink of our order on three separate occasions. It finally came out, after all of our food did. 

Portions were small. Several of my friends had the cheesesteak, which had way more bread than filling. I ordered the Old Bay Wings. Small portion as well when you consider they were about $14.

Our server was incredibly frazzled by the crowd and accused one of our coworkers of walking out on her tab. Turns out she had left her card, went to take a phone call, was gone for about 10 minutes and assumed that when she came back that her card had been run since it was still on the table. She left a cash tip and then went back outside to finish her phone call. It was an honest mistake on her part and 6 of us were still sitting at the table.

Between the crowd, the music and the TVs, it was so loud that I couldn't hear the people sitting on either side of me talk.  Will definitely not be back even if I stay at the hotel again.",newamerican

Instead of looking for a place to go I got lazy and popped into SoHo (which was located right in the hotel I was straying at) to order some dinner before taking it back to my room. The staff was super friendly and the menu had a decent amount to offer. It didn't take me long to pick something as the special pork belly burger immediately caught the eye of both me and my stomach. The food was made super fast and they even gave me a refill of my ginger ale before I left. When I got back to my room and finally dug in, I was in a pork belly burger heaven. The pork belly was absolutely delicious and actually made my mouth water. The mashed potatoes that the burger was served with were pretty darn good as well. 

Overall, SoHo did me right and I have no complaints at all. I loved my pork belly burger, the staff was friendly, and the restaurant itself was super nice as well. If you need somewhere to eat downtown, I would totally recommend SoHo!",newamerican

1511,4.0,oJsfjG1uh6jopK6Kc-3pdQ,"Cavo is probably my favorite Pittsburgh nightclub. The first thing I noticed during my earlier years visiting was that it reminded me a bit of the old station square Matrix with a different music style and scene in each room area. Another thing I like about it is it seems like different age groups fit in well whether younger 20s-30s to 40s. The back room is more of the younger hip hop vibe while the front area is usually a more calm, laid back Spanish music choice. The middle area is sort of more chill mingling area rather than dancing. The drink prices are high but pretty average for nightclubs. It is sort of difficult to get bartender attention on super busy nights. 

The dress code is pretty typical. I believe no jeans and basketball shoes. I don't think there is any more entry allowed after 1am? There isn't usually a cover charge, I think there may have been on special occasions. There is a $1 fee for coat storage for those that don't use cash, might be good to know. I really like the deco outside the nightclub. I've seen a DJ here multiple times. I really don't think I ever had a bad time here, met several friendly people over the visits.

1515,4.0,soPVIcC8dVfRhj2RObE8QQ,"The PA Market is a two-story food market located across from Primanti Brothers in the Strip District. There's 4 kitchen stations and an international wine library upstairs along with tons of seating. 

After seeing some **amazing** charcuterie board photos on Instagram, I was REALLY looking forward to getting a cheese board but there wasn't anyone to be found at the Charcuterie station. Bummer.

So, we opted for a variety of Roman pizzas at ROMULUS PIZZA AL TAGLIO. The pizzas LOOKED dense and heavy but after biting into it, we were surprised that the crust was very crispy & airy. Apparently, the dough is crispy and sturdy so it can handle a ton of toppings, but its light and airy enough to eat an extra slice (which I did!) The dough has less flour and more water -- almost 90% water so it may LOOK like a slice of Sicilian pizza but you'll be pleasantly surprised when you bite into this! $6/slice. Order & pay at the counter, find a table (most are communal style) and your pizza is brought out a few minutes later. Each is cut in half if you want to order a variety to sample & share.

WINE LIBRARY - After walking around the Strip, relaxing for a bit at the Wine Library was just what I needed so we eventually returned to the PA market a few hours later. We opted for wine flights. The attendant was very pleasant as she offered up suggestions. The hubby and brother in law also had a few local beers from the bar connected to the Wine Library. 

I was surprised that the Wine Library wasn't busier on a Saturday afternoon but perhaps it's busier in the evenings or after work hours. Regardless, having a few drinks lounging in the couches was a nice end to an afternoon at the Strip. 

I docked a star because the Charcuterie attendant eventually showed up later AFTER I placed my order two stations over. Ugh. Also, we didn't get a chance to try out anything at the courtyard since it appeared to be closed that Saturday afternoon. I'm not sure if it was closed because it's cold/early November or if it's only open in the evenings. 

Anyway, it's worth popping into the Pennsylvania Market for a quick snack, full meal and a drink or two.",newamerican
1516,3.0,soPVIcC8dVfRhj2RObE8QQ,"Very interesting concept in the heart of the strip district. Similar to Smallman, this is a self serve kinda place. Want wine? get it yourself. Want pizza? Get it yourself.

I love that there are two restaurants on the same floor, adds some variety. I went with the Bistro, and had the salmon. My spinach side was covered in salt and butter - but the salmon was quite tasty. I also ordered a side of fries, also a greasy combo. A friend of mine was able to order an omelette here - which he liked. However, there was mold on the bread he was served.

Some friends ordered pizza, for about $5 a slice (slices were big) and although they liked it, they weren't raving over it by any means. 

The atmosphere is definitely a little more upscale which is nice. I would have loved some music, a band, anything! Just people talking in a big open room. 

Would like to stop back in when the courtyard is open, but would probably eat elsewhere before coming for cocktails or wine.",newamerican

1518,4.0,soPVIcC8dVfRhj2RObE8QQ,"The PA Market is one of the examples where I wish I could provide ratings on the different aspects of my experience.  I really want this place to do well. It was my third visit here. The building spans the whole length of the block so you can either enter on the 18th Street side via the courtyard where the stalls may or may not be open depending on time of day and time of year and go up those stairs to the second floor space. Or you can enter on the 19th Street side by the door between the Olive Tap Store and Stan's Market  and take the elevator or stairs to the second floor space. I find the space inviting in ambiance with warm lighting in the evening, loads of natural light during the day with wood flooring throughout. The room temperature is always just right for me as I prefer not to freeze in air conditioning during the warm months and I like feeling toasty in the cooler months. The regular bar in the middle is rustic with a gorgeous stone counter.  The distinct wine bar is much smaller and instead the wine library seating section has some comfortable lounge chairs and the feel of a home library (there was live jazz music last night). It offers wine by the glass, flights, and bottles from around the world. There are happy hour specials @ both bars. When I have been there mostly on a weekday for Happy Hour, it's a classy hip crowd and not too crowded. Hence, my 4-star rating.  If you stick with charcuterie boards for food, it compliments the quality of wines. The other 3 food stations don't tempt my appetite for dinner or brunch. Besides the charcuterie station, there is a pasta station, pizza station, and variety of cruises station.  I've tried something different each visit and I don't come for the food so my rating for the food would be 3-stars (I'm not a fan of the food offerings but maybe you will be).",newamerican

As I was sitting here on my second drink I was thinking that wow this girl has probably been the most genuine sincere bartender feel I've ever had in all Pittsburgh area. Especially since mt wash isn't my area I had no clue what to expect. It was very refreshing to have a bartender who doesn't make it seem like you're a chore and that they are happy to see you sit down.

1525,4.0,B7pcNWBNTXl4WZ22Y-2x6A,"Let me preface this by saying I wish we could give 1/2 stars because I probably would give this a 3 1/2.

First, it's pricey. I came here for brunch and got the ""big"" meal ($11) and a mimosa ($8). Don't get me wrong, the food and drinks were really good. I got the 'Breakfast with a View' which came with 2 eggs, home fries, bacon, sausage, and one slice of toast. Everything was there and it was plenty but I was a little surprised that the toast was just one slice and the home fries could probably fit in a small dressing container. Like I said, it was the perfect amount of food (left feeling full but not bloated) but for $11 it seemed like there was something missing. I also got the build-your-own mimosa. This starts at $6 for just the basic champagne + juice (orange, grapefruit, pineapple, or another that I'm forgetting) and then you can do add-ons ($1 for a sherbet and $2 for a puree). It was very good but also pretty small as it was served in a more traditional champagne flute. 

What you're really paying for is the ambiance. We sat on the back patio and it has a really different and cool view of the city. It also makes you feel much more secluded, so it was perfect for a nice date. The front of the building also seemed that it would be a good place to sit. There's basically three/four different sitting areas; back patio (secluded), indoors (traditional style), indoor/outdoor bar (perfect for the solo diner and drinker or for a small group looking for drinks), and outdoor front patio (a bit more lively).

I probably will go back. The rest of the menu seems appetizing and the draft list is extensive, but this will be saved for a 'treat-yo-self' night out and not a regular dining experience.",newamerican
1526,2.0,B7pcNWBNTXl4WZ22Y-2x6A,"After being open now for a year and a half, I have just come to accept this place for what it is...a great drinking spot, with terrible food.  It is unfortunate because I love the atmosphere and drink offerings they have.  There are not many other places which have such a unique outdoor venue.  However, the food is and has always been bad.  

My first time I thought maybe the disgusting buffalo chicken dip was just part of the growing pains of a new restaurant (although I'm not sure how you mess up a dish with 3-4 ingredients).  My second time I chalked up the awful tasting chips, salsas, and sloppy sandwiches again to the place being new.  However, after now being here at least 5 times, being new is no longer an excuse.  On my most recent trip we tried the new taco spot connected to the side porch.  The chicken taco was sloppy and tasted like they poured an entire bottle of liquid smoke into it.  The chicken itself was tough and dry.  None of the flavors of any of the tacos I tried came together.  At one point in our meal a group at another table was asked to leave because they had McDonalds delivered and were eating it at a table.  When asked about it by staff, one person in the group suggested that if the food at Coughlin's wasn't so terrible they wouldn't have to resort to having McDonalds delivered.  While this was rude and probably a slight exaggeration, it goes to show how people feel about the food.

The blackened scallops on fried green tomatoes were amazing and totally worth the trip. The salad was also good and Bryan's dessert was very good, too. The drinks were good and pricey. The parfait (and I LOVE parfaits) was horrible and made me google the definition of parfait to see if their dessert qualified (it doesn't). A parfait is supposed to be ""a dessert consisting of layers of ice cream, fruit, etc., served in a tall glass."" Sadly, this dessert was dry cake layered with a mashed blackberry sauce & topped with whipped cream. Not at ALL what I thought I was getting and too dry (even with the sauce) to be remotely worth the calories.

Parking - good; there is street parking, a lot across from the restaurant that's a flat rate of $10; some scattered street parking 1-2 blocks back that is free.

Food - excellent. We had the calamari to start, then I had the lobster tails and my boyfriend had the lobster mac and cheese. Both were great. His was a bit too rich for my liking, but he loved it.

Drinks - pretty good. They have a long list of signature cocktails and wine, but not as many beer choices.

Service - only thing that wasn't great. Our appetizer took almost 30mins to come out. It also took our waitress 10+ minutes to ask if we wanted another drink, and she didn't bring any water until after our meals came out.

As soon as we're inside and checked in the hostess said we were early but could sit near the door or hit the bar. Cool. Then that i must remove my baseball cap. Fine. Then she told me to remove my hoodie... Uh, what? (since it's 40deg outside and I'm wearing no outer coat just a v-neck t, ""hoodie"", scarf and sport coat). I ask to see the written policy since i read their brief dress code policy which said nothing about ""hoodies"" under sport coats. There IS another written policy which seems to ban all sorts of casual wear like for someone stomping in drunk from a tail gate (or imho ""urban"" area), but a cashmere sweater under a  Hugo Boss sport coat (which some might say is stylish) may be letter of law (for this ""not publicly disclosed"" policy) does not meet the spirit. The hostess also curtly and dismissively told me THAT policy is on their website and open table (where i made my rsvp)... It isn't. The most wordy dress code simply states ""business casual or better"" was also the only thing added to the confirmation vm i received. Anyway before i could get a manager, the birthday girl was tucking my hood down my back to appease all but me. 

Next, bar area was packed and tenders were overburdened. So we sat near the crowded reception another 10min then were seated.

We got a coveted window seat (i booked over a month in advance, not sure if that or me being chill, yet noticeably annoyed, at reception got us the table). The evening view is spectacular.

The service by Hattie was also top notch. The gf would say I'm an unapologetic, Freakonomics listening, horrid tipper, ""urban"", 15% tops, even at multiple Michelin star spots.  Hattie took great care of bday girl and me beyond the rest of the experience, i left her a nice token of my appreciation.

Finally the food... mediocre AT BEST. This is NOT the place to be wowed by the entrees. Veal Osso Bucco and LC Gulf Black Grouper, both underwhelming. Bread pudding dessert and the candled bday cardboard, yuck. The crab toast and bisque were ok though.

What I was most impressed with at Altius was the commitment to quality.  From the cocktails, to the service, to the food, a detailed eye has been made to invest in quality drinks, people, ingredients.  Our appetizers arrived and I was able to try the charcuterie, the beef tartarre, and the salmon poke.  The meats and cheeses on the charcuterie were fantastic and high end.  The beef tartarre was well made and didn't have that funky flavor that it sometimes can get.  The poke was fresh, though i thought it needed one other note.  That note was provided in the sauce spread on the side of the plate, however there just wasn't enough.p

For my entree, I enjoyed the lamb with a side of risotto.  As a risotto snob, I would say this is the best authentic risotto that I have found in Pittsburgh.  The lamb was good, though a bit on the gamey side for me.  Others didn't seem to think so, thus it was probably just my personal preferences and it didn't stop me from enjoying the entire plate.

If you have a special event, date or anniversary coming up, for sure head to Altius but make sure you make a reservation in advance! You won't regret it.",newamerican
1540,4.0,zLzRiXSCYrUEpA2MuvZihw,"The Revel & Roost joint website is odd. It seemed like Revel is ONLY open for breakfast and brunch, but when we got to the restaurant, both parts were open. (Looking at their website more closely, I found their dinner, but the way they advertise it on the main page is odd.) We hope to try Revel at some point. 

Roost had very good food and a bunch of things I wanted to try, though their menu was pretty limited. Roost has no happy hour drink specials, so if you want one of those, stop in Revel downstairs first. Roost was also fairly empty, so we didn't really need a reservation, but I like to make them to be safe if they take reservations.

The dish I was most interested in (scallops) had a lot I didn't like (I tried it, since my friend got it and I'm glad I skipped it, since I'm not a fan of peppers), but they have a scallop appetizer I'd like to get next time. The dinner also came with some delicious bread and dipping sauces/spreads. There was a LOT of food, so an appetizer wasn't necessary. I ate all the best stuff from my meal, but couldn't have possibly finished my meal after sharing the appetizer. Very good service and food. I'd definitely recommend it & look forward to trying Revel.",newamerican
1541,2.0,zLzRiXSCYrUEpA2MuvZihw,"My wife picked this place to try for restaurant week in Pittsburgh. We seldom go downtown for dinner and used this opportunity to try somewhere new. Restaurant week featured a 3 course meal from Roost which my wife and I both decided to partake in.

Roost is just a short walk away from market square and it's on the second floor as you walk into the building. We were seated fairly quickly upon arriving with reservations. The inside is extremely impressive; it is very clean and portrays a fancy classy atmosphere. 

Before our food came out we were given bread with cinnamon butter and sweet pepper jam. The sweet pepper jam didn't really work for me with the bread, but the cinnamon butter was on par. For my appetizer round I ordered the burrata cheese which came with a peach brulee, blackberry reduction, and grilled ciabatta. I found this dish a little challenging to eat together, but overall Ok to try. The burrata cheese itself is a rather interesting concept and texture. The peach is really the only complaint I have as you could tell it wasn't a fresh peach even though they were in season at the time. For my entree I ordered the salmon. It came on a bed of green beens and had a orange butter puree spread around the dish. The salmon dish was cooked nicely. For dessert I had chocolate cheesecake which ended up being way too much to finish. It was solid and a good portion size.

The reason why this is a 2 star for me is the service. The bartender (I think it was Bob) was our waiter and ended up having to wait on us, 6 other tables, and 2 people at the bar. One of the tables had 8 people around it and so he was constantly running around and apologizing to tables for the delay. He even apologized to us for our entree as one of the other tables who arrived well after us received their entree before us. Bob was even having to run the food himself despite appearing that there were other staff members standing around. Bob was able to stay very well composed and calm for being extremely overwhelmed. Our dinner ended up taking us 3 hours to eat 3 courses with some long waiting periods in between dishes. This is very unacceptable for the price. It wasn't until we had our dessert brought out some staff or manager was upstairs helping. By this time it was far too late. 

Overall decent food but not worth the agony of the disorganization. I would steer clear of here unless you have lots of time to kill. It's unfortunate because this sort of disorganization seems very avoidable.",newamerican
1542,2.0,zLzRiXSCYrUEpA2MuvZihw,"I was really excited to try this place out and was quickly disappointed. We made reservations on Friday night and were the only people in the restaurant when we walked up. I guess that should have been our first sign. Our waitress brought out some bread and a cinnamon butter and a chili pepper jelly. The bread was probably the best part of the meal. It was all downhill from there. We started with the crabcakes - they were ""okay""...definitely not worth the $16. For an entree, my husband ordered a medium rare ribeye and I ordered the seabass special. In the words of my husband, it was ""a small town Denny's steak served at NYC price. Overcooked and tasteless meat. The mashed potatoes were good though."" The seabass was disappointing as well. I found a bone in each of the first 3 bites. The asparagus was good though, I guess. Still, we stuck it out and tried some dessert - more disappointment. The summer cobbler was super crumbly and tasteless and you needed a knife to try to cut through the peaches. I will never go back and waste my money there again. Way too expensive for what you're given.

One good thing I can say is that our waitress was nice and attentive.",newamerican

1545,5.0,z4EIzLJlGd7gyje1Q_hKtw,"I love that the Galley group has introduced the concept of the food hall to Pittsburgh, and has done so with two awesome locations. 

Federal Galley is a great space, with plenty of open space and seating indoors, and outdoor seating in both the back and front of the building. The floor to ceiling windows/doors that open make this place always feel bright and happy. The food options are solid (I won't go into too many details in this general review). It seems that the owners do a nice job of rotating interesting and unique restaurant concepts through so there are options for every tastebud that walks in. 

My favorite part of Federal Galley? Half price happy hour. What better way to end the workday (or workweek) with a half-priced glass of wine (or cocktail or local craft beer). I have been hard-pressed to find a happy hour in Pittsburgh that I enjoy as much as this one. I also appreciate the live music on the weekend and the many cool different events that are hosted here. Thanks, Federal Galley, for being a beloved staple of the northside!",newamerican
1546,4.0,z4EIzLJlGd7gyje1Q_hKtw,"We love Smallman Galley, so we're excited to head to the North Side and check our Federal Galley. It's the same concept of four restaurants under one roof, as well as a bar area. I love that there are so many different options. There's truly something for everyone, which is great when you can't agree on what you're in the mood for for dinner! 

We ordered from Which Came First (grilled chicken salad) and Shaka (spicy salmon poke bowl). We enjoyed both options, and they were delivered to our table very quickly after ordering. They also offer a great happy hour of 1/2 off all beer, wine, and cocktails from 4:30-6:30 PM. There were only a few options of wine, but an extensive list of different beers on tap, as well as specialty cocktails. The only thing I didn't love at the bar area is there were a bunch of tiny flies; that's definitely not a deal breaker, as the food and drinks were delicious, but just something we noticed that wasn't great.",newamerican
1547,3.0,z4EIzLJlGd7gyje1Q_hKtw,"Smallman Galley is one of my favorite places in PGH, so I have been itching to try Federal Galley for quite some time now! Love the concept, allowing different chefs to have their time to shine at the restaurant - a great way to get new chefs off and running!  The North Shore location is a lot bigger than the Strip District one and tons of outdoor seating, so much better to go to with groups especially in the summer time. Warning that the location is a little hidden - it's in an almost business park-like area, so have to search a little bit for it. 

We went for brunch on a Sunday, and surprisingly it wasn't overly crowded. When first looking at the restaurants' brunch menus, I honestly wasn't overly excited - a lot of it was standard fare brunch options. There was also an underwhelming number of ""sweet"" choices, which is usually my go-to for brunch. Regardless, we both decided to go for Which Came First, a southern-inspired, home-cooking restaurant which had the most exciting choices to us. My BF and I actually swapped preferences - he went ""sweet"" with the ""State Fair"" and I ""savory"" with the ""Georgia Benedict."" The State Fair was v unique, with funnel cake fries topped with a berry compote and fried chicken. The chicken had a sweet tinge to it that complimented the flavors of the fries nicely - my BF said this was one of the best breakfast chickens he's had! The Benedict was a unique take on a classic dish, featuring fried green tomatoes instead of English muffin and rosemary ham. The flavors of the ham brought out the flavors of the hollandaise, bringing the dish together. I enjoyed it - not the best Benedict I've had, but tasty. Important to note is that the restaurants themselves do not serve coffee, so was a little confused on how to order. I guessed right that the bar had some - however, it's not listed anywhere, so that's a little confusing. And when I received our coffees, there were not any ""sleeves"" on them, so it was super difficult to carry them without burning my hands. Lastly, I walked around the restaurant twice to try to find the cream/sugar - finally found it, but that also was secret and only offered the individual creamer packets and sugar-in-the-raw. For such a trendy place, I was expecting a little more robust of a coffee selection, so this was a little disappointing. However, we still enjoyed our overall meal despite!

Overall, we had a lovely brunch at Federal Galley, especially sitting out on the patio on a beautiful day. Definitely recommend up-ing the coffee game for the future to please brunchers. Would love to try for HH or dinner so I can experience other restaurants (while they're still there!)",newamerican
1548,5.0,z4EIzLJlGd7gyje1Q_hKtw,"My husband and I love federal galley. This is one of the places we keep going back to. They have a rotating drink menu that usually features a charity cocktail (they donate $1-2 dollars if the drink to a selected charity). The drinks are always a good mix of sweet, sour, and complex and keep you from getting bored. The happy hour is great at 1/2 off all drinks! I do wish the restaurants would feature specials like Smallman galley does. The rotating restaurants keep things interesting. My current favorite is provision, they have a fun take on comfort food and always have big portions. The aioli they serve with the fries is amazing (although the fries are a little over salted).",newamerican
1549,5.0,z4EIzLJlGd7gyje1Q_hKtw,"Great lunch visit for all to this bustling food court with a great local beer selection. There are about five food businesses here, clean bathrooms, and a bar that serves up 25 (mostly) local beers on draft. 

I had a great meal by Guapo restaurant of New Mexican Carne Adovada enchiladas, served Xmas style with both green and red Hatch chile  pepper sauce. I paired it with a local beer by Cinderstown brewery. The rest of our party of four raved about their food, and it's great to have options when traveling with a group. 

There's a front patio, but the back patio looked amazing! Street parking was easy to find. Check 'em out!",newamerican

I special ordered my chicken tenders dipped in buffalo with ranch. They were perfectly cooked, nice thick flavorful ranch, and crispy light fries. I was happy with it. The guy a few bar stools away said his burger and fries were great. Pricy for portion, but gets the job done. Food was out fast and better than expected.
Seems like locals hang out there. Very friendly.",newamerican
